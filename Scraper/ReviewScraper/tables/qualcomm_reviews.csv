It’s a very political place, with a lot of political power given to directors of groups. So if your director is good, you can get better salary, better bonuses and timely promotions.
If your director isn’t good, good luck getting promoted even to senior engineer (btw promotion = 10k salary increase, which is way too small).

If you are in remote site (not in SD that is), good luck with finding opportunities for career growth within the company. Utterly disgraceful management, with loads of VPs reporting each other, who do nothing valuable for growth of this company. Upper management doesn’t really care for even basic needs of engineers (like monumental pay increase, creating work-friendly environment). Review system is biased and managers don’t really care about third party opinions (why even take them, if you don’t care about them?)

There are better companies out there. Avoid like plague.","Value your employees. Typically engineers. They are the ones who fill your pockets and make you filthy rich. Pay them well.

Also, total compensation package is not very competitive compared to the competitors. This also often causes staff and senior staff engineers to quit and seek for better compensation.

The tools and processes engineers must deal with on a daily basis are a source of frustration.
Legal woes have been a constant overhang on employee morale (and compensation) for the last several years... and it seems it's still not finished.
Management is clumsily re-learning how to show their appreciation for employees by inviting thousands of employees to a launch party on one of the campuses where we get to wait in horribly long lines just to get a free taco and a beer. Employee appreciation is nothing like what it used to be.
HR keeps fiddling with the performance review process and rating system, yet at the end of it all the rating system and forced curve-fitting ends up destroying employee morale even further.",Demand vision and leadership from your senior leaders.

Product management has the ability to directly comment and influence the careers of everyone in marketing yet marketing is given no ability to provide similar feedback on product management individuals in the review cycle. There is also very limited upward mobility in marketing, making working there a constant pressure cooker environment. That plus having to deal with a perpetual budgeting process makes marketing at Qualcomm a high-stress, low rewarding job. Because Qualcomm pays extremely well, it becomes extremely hard for anyone in marketing to challenge product management or take real control of the marketing process, which becomes dictated to marketing by product management. Marketing is, in effect, treated as a second class citizen within the org, and this is highlighted by the fact that the company has had a dozen different people managing marketing over the last decade.

Also, with repeated layoffs and understaffed departments, it’s near Impossible to find a time “convenient to the business” to take any time off. Headcount is cut in half in some areas while workload only grows, and there is no concern for employee welfare and how to resolve tired over-worked employees having unrealistic workload to manage. New merit review system removes manager ability to individually reward high performers (it is all decided by compensation team). High performers are given minuscule salary increases below cost of living increase; how does this
motivate anyone? No end in sight to mountains of work growing with no plans to add resources, only more reductions.","Stop killing your staff with unrealistic amounts of work with little reward. If you don’t take care of people they will keep leaving. Make people take mandatory vacation time for their own mental health, it is shown to increase productivity. Also give bigger raises and bonuses to keep them— it is cheaper than what you lose when they quit and you need to find, hire, and train new people.",3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0
