In the past five years, the standard of quality has gone from excruciatingly high to preposterously low. 

While political correctness and identity politics run rampant, gender discrimination is still quite prevalent, despite all the internal corporate propaganda stating otherwise. And nobody, man nor woman, should feel comfortable growing old there. Experience has become a liability as the company is clearly focused on lowering the average age (and salary) of non-management employees through attrition, targeted layoffs and firings.

You shouldn’t consider Bloomberg News as a mid-career journalist. If you’re age 40 or older, don’t even bother applying. You probably won't even land an interview, let alone get hired. They have been actively recruiting minorities and LGBTQ people, though. So there might be some exceptions if you fit any of those categories. It does seem like a good fit for a kid just out of college looking to get some experience and then move on to something better. Sadly, it’s become that kind of place.",No advice because it all appears to be going according to their plan.,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0

Not a finance job but a financial product ambassador; people do modelling and financial analysis but it is just to make ""clients"" have ease of use and show more functionality for the terminal.

I've been with them for over a decade and have gotten to see this company get worse over the years. It used to be a great company that looked after its employees, but over last 2 years they have been looking to get rid of anyone with a decent salary and tenure. Have been replacing with kids out of college at a fraction of the salary and zero experience then working them to death, turnover is staggering with very high numbers of new recruits leaving within the first 2 years. Sales managers have almost no experience of selling and are promoted only for their micro management prowess. 

Sales targets are ridiculous and they count net performance, that means that salesperson takes a hit for any removals, but gets NO credit for renewals. Sales is blamed for every removal even though product teams have not developed a decent product in almost a decade, and are obsessed with growing revenue even though there is no new product/service to help in the growth. So their strategy has been to double/triple/quadruple prices for existing services which makes it extremely difficult to have any new sales discussion with this clients, then blame is laid upon the sales force for not hitting ridiculous targets.",Come down from your ivory towers and experience a day in the life of your employees or better yet speak to one of your customers before you reach your ridiculous business decisions.,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

Additionally, there are excellent exit opportunities from what I've heard from past employees.","First, let's get the job description straight. If you choose to join the analytics program you will be a customer service representative where you will be ""on queue"". Quite literally called ""The Help Desk"" you will be treated as if you work at Comcast and will solve client inqurires (usually 3 at a time). Questions could include but are not limited too:
""CALL ME""
""My launchpad is broken""
""Can you confirm the IPO date 943819 US Equity was on 9/8/2017?""

However, it's truly the management that lack of empathy that creates an environment that makes the desk an inky black hole where every molecule of light/joy cannot escape. A few examples include:
-Time off has to be asked 120 days in advance no matter the situation during the holidays/summer
-No breaks (including the bathroom) are to be given if the queue is busy
-Genuine disregard for the emotions, aspirations, and general well being of employees.

You'll be expected to dedicate yourself and your life to Michael Bloomberg and his philanthropic ventures. There's no such thing as work-life balance at Bloomberg, just work-work. While you may be scheduled to work 9 hour days (don't even think about taking a lunch break) it's more likely you'll be working 10 hour days and 11 and 12 hour days are not uncommon. For all that hard work and effort you'll be rewarded with zero job security. Loyalty is very much a one-way street at Bloomberg and layoffs are routine. Your future is solely dependent on your manager, and they change often. My first 6 reviews at Bloomberg were written by 6 different bosses. If you get one that takes a dislike to you, regardless of your performance, you're toast. I've seen hard-working, talented employees get the boot while workers who literally spend the day on their Facebook page, texting and take 2 hour lunches keep their jobs. Additionally, if you're over 50 your days are numbered. Yes, the company that prides itself on its philanthropic initiatives routinely practices age discrimination.",,1.0,,,,,

There is a segment of the company that is genuinely interested in leveraging cutting edge technology and making an impact. However, there is an equally large segment of the company that is reluctant to relinquish the practices they’ve been using since the mid 90s. For example, many teams use relatively modern python; but there were times where I encountered teams with no interest with updating their Linux incompatible C++93. The company has largely stagnated between these opposing factions.

There’s also a mediocre to at times hostile work environment for engineers belonging to underrepresented groups. The workforce is largely male and there are almost no engineers from ethnically underrepresented groups. This can create a lonely environment as the undiverse management doesn’t seem interested in going beyond lip service.","Hire more diverse managers and make an actionable commitment to improving the workplace, technically and otherwise.",3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0

Tue Aug 27 2019 13:29:11 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Journalist,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Bloomberg News.....The Gilead of the media world..,I worked at Bloomberg L.P. full-time for more than 8 years,3,The quiet editors deemed unfashionable whose ability to take copy that is akin to scribble and turn it into something legible are the unsung heroes of that place. Sadly the scribblers tend to be promoted.,"* Micromanagement on steroids. Cameras everywhere, key strokes monitored and the time you are in the office is also measured. Make no mistake if you are one minute late expect to get an email.

* BULLYING CULTURE....it is sad to watch people who are elevated to management embrace the culture and start sending emails to people who were once friends about Bloomberg standards (which are Gilead like), social media responsibility (apply self censorship muzzle here) and writing news stories that resemble bullet points so as to keep your metrics up.

* On social media, the transgressions from personal twitter accounts were so trivial that most either stopped using social media or found alternate employment.

* SHOUTING AT STAFF IS GOOD...APPARENTLY? !!!!! Any organisation where screaming at subordinates is considered standard is one that will result in the victim seeking some form of medication, treatment, and having their self worth destroyed.....or they embrace the same behavior. Bloomberg is full of bullying managers who cannot leave their staff alone to do their jobs....constant hectoring and poor processes only compound the problem.

* POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AT A LEVEL APPROACHING MADNESS - Mike Bloomberg's weird personal views on workplace loyalty, climate change and a decent society is where the organization shaped in his likeness reaches rank hypocrisy. Despite the wacky obsession about sugary drinks in New York, the wall of sugar at the company's hideous neon offices are a reminder to never leave and drink soda for 12 hours (sorry, 14 hours a day).

* Bloomberg LP has been sued many times for being hostile to women, especially pregnant women. Despite the PR about how the company has embraced flexibility, such pieces are complete fiction and do not tell the real story of what happens when many women return from maternity leave. Feel free to read the NY Times to get the company view on females who dare to have a baby. 'Mayor Shows His Testy Side in Deposition for a Lawsuit' on April 14, 2011.'

* CLIMATE CHANGE HYPOCRISY - Bloomberg LP relies on terminal sales to many industries and takes money from BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore, Whitehaven Coal....wait! yes coal companies whom Mike Bloomberg wants to shut down. (Mike is annoyed that people are apathetic about the approaching apocalypse but like children who rebel against religious parents it is simply a case of normal folk rebelling against having an issue shoved down their throat by billionaires. Nothing gets a Bloomberg editor giddy around the loins like the image of Hollywood stars flying in private jets to exclusive resorts to give lectures on climate and consumerism. It is amazing the air time given to people who wear spandex and pose in front of green screens for a living. 

* Like Gilead, Bloomberg has an army of Editors at Large (commanders)......this is code for former Team Leaders and Bureau Chiefs who have been kept on to write 2000 word op-eds no one reads and to hold forth in strategy sessions about what politics mean for a given country. The Sydney bureau is blessed with several Commanders in these roles as its leadership wrestles with the most gripping issue facing the island nation........Australia's misogyny problem. Month after month, the Sydney bureau's self-flagellation results in snore fests of how to get women into management positions......forget the economy, this is where the real new stories are at! (it was amazing to learn that outside the Bloomberg offices, there are men walking down the road holding their wife or girlfriend's hand.......there is hope for Australia yet).

* Not to be outdone, the London bureau have a cool social club....the LGBTQI_Women_Climate_Change_More_Women_in_Leadership_Diversity Social Club.....sadly I didn't get to join this social club.....

* Vacation is all but in name only....",None....you guys are bonkers.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

The CEO is amazing and some awesome colleagues. Plenty of young colleagues (if you're younger and starting out). Volunteering activities are great. Company is serious about philanthropy.,"Global Data is a joke and a revolving door for college grads. They make you go through a fairly lengthy interview process, but the full-time role is a joke. Trust me when I say that you're not doing anything finance related. You're in a back-office role doing manual data entry which can be automated at any time. In fact, Bloomberg is pushing for automation so I wouldn't be surprised to see Global Data dissolved. Also it really matters which team you land on. No matter what, STAY AWAY from fixed income. Specifically the mortgages team and to some extent bonds. You'll be going through all the same issues as everyone else in Global Data but with A LOT more work than your non-fixed income colleagues. Besides Global Data being a joke, be prepared to face A LOT of politics. There's politics all over the place. Since there's so many fresh college grads, it feels like college with college drama. ""Senior leaders"" are outdated. Some have been with the company for several decades simply because of their connections. In fact, since there's so many people for so few TL spots, the only way to move up is to be friends with management. You get ""unlimited sick days"" but no one takes them because there's a stigma. If you do end up taking one, if it's Friday or Monday, be ready to face judgement when you're back. Work from home is also so so hard to get. It's pretty basic these for companies to offer this, but the company doesn't want to set a standard of working from home daily. Thus, managers are encouraged to not let their teams work from home. As for career prospects after, there's very little. Poor at best. Think about it, you're not doing finance so no banks want you. Since you're doing data entry all day, you're not developing technical or finance skills. Also you're working with Bloomberg systems which isn't applicable to other companies. If you were working with SAP, Qlik, Tableau then that would actually be useful but you're not. Lastly, the location sucks. You're not in Princeton, you're in freaking- Skillman, New Jersey.

Fri May 24 2019 09:31:17 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Analytics Representative,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,AVOID - toxic,I have been working at Bloomberg L.P. full-time for less than a year,14,The office has a nice view of the water and Micheal Bloomberg is a great guy,"Let me start by saying my time at Bloomberg did not start off as bad as it eventually got. Once you start off as a ""financial analytics"" representative they provide you with training which makes you feel like you're learning a lot about finance. In reality they are only teaching you how to use the Bloomberg terminal which is an outdated piece of software from the 80s with an offensive user interface. The name ""financial analytics"" representative really stands for customer service representative. You work at the help desk. Your entire day is answering tons customer service ""tickets"" that come into the help desk. There is nothing analytical or financial about this position. When a financial professional comes into the help desk Its your job to search the terminal (most of the time literally searching in the search bar) to find whatever number or news story they are looking for. All you do for 8/9 hours a day is answer help desk questions for clients who 90% of the time are rude and in a hurry for the answer because they value their time much more than yours. 

Here is where the ""toxic"" work culture comes from. Every morning that you log in you have a dashboard of your 10+ metrics which are constantly being compared to your coworkers. if your numbers are even percentage lower than your ""peer average"" prepare to be constantly reminded by your managers to get your customer satisfaction numbers up. Coworkers check each others dashboards to make sure their metrics are better to avoid being in the bottom 10%. Management takes that bottom 10% and will put them on a performance plan and even threaten to terminate their employment. Management uses manipulative tactics to make sure their employees are solving as many ""tickets"" as humanly possible, like you are a robot. 

I understand a job can be stressful, I understand that as an employee you are required to perform for the company. But I have never seen a company where people come in and leave with a constant feeling of anxiety that they need to out perform their peers and stretch themselves to a limit to hit metrics. This is not a sales, finance, or analytical job. This is a over the top and extremely stressful customer service job.",If you want robots working at the help desk then invest in AI and have actual robots answer customer questions. Don't use manipulation to get employees to hit their metrics. Listen to your employees and learn why they may feel stressed and support them. They are more than numbers on a dash board and work tirelessly to answer all client questions. This job is not an easy one and it would help if you actually tried to give support instead of staring at our metrics all day and jumping on us when you see a change. Do more and do better.,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,

Editorial folks' comp is good vs. what else is out there, and why many never want to leave.","But there's a rule for everything at Bloomberg that's paralyzing and has highly competent, intelligent professionals constantly feeling the need to seek affirmation of a half dozen leaders/authorities before acting. In my role, for instance, I've got 4-5 people to manage but 5-6 bosses. It's a much different vibe than anywhere I've been. Also say ""adios"" to your personal time. If you commute, expect a 12-14 hour day. Bloomberg has finally evolved with the times a bit by allowing people to telecommute here and there, but each day is drudgery. Instead of fixing a simply typo of a company name, for instance, the offender deals with a belabored, almost embarrassing process of having to re-run a story with the correction, deleting the old one off the system, then writing a letter to several managers to detail exactly what went wrong; so God forbid you spell it Proctor & Gamble instead of Procter & Gamble -- total rabbit hole that eats up tons of time and distracts. This is where Bloomberg takes its mantra of being candid to unproductive extremes and creates a sense of arrogance among the higher-ups that what Bloomberg does is above the level of its rivals. It's utter nonsense, as is the sense that employees can be rated based on cockeyed data points focused on production levels rather than quality of the work.","Ditch all data sets behind employee rankings and eliminate the micromanagement that's crippling to experienced professionals. Reduce the workday to something more manageable instead of burning out your employees with sweatshop hours. And if you're going to give away tons of the company's profit to charities, at least give each employee the option to designate their own organization.

Mon Feb 04 2019 18:13:22 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Analyst,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Diversity and Inclusion — What a Joke!,I have been working at Bloomberg L.P. full-time for more than 5 years,22,There is free food and snacks consistently at your disposal. The organization is big on volunteering and philanthropic endeavors so working here will afford you the opportunity to make an impact on other people’s lives outside of the company. That’s the full extent of the benefits in my opinion.,"Now here are the cons:

First, take heed to many of the comments written about managers. Many managers currently in place have moved up the pipeline through connections or likability - not through grit or hard work. In addition, your initial manager will define your success or failure before you step foot in the door so my advice, make sure to do some vetting before you accept an offer here. 

Second, while the company is great at tackling challenges outside of the organization, there is a significant amount of work to be done on diversity and inclusion front. Let me explain: If you are a cis White male, you will have countless opportunities at your disposal even if you lack the education, experience or credentials. Leadership within the organization is akin to a fraternity where you’re accepted based on whether you’re liked by management and not by how hard you work. 

This moves me to my next point - women and minorities in leadership. Of the 19k+ employees worldwide, Black employees make up less than 3.8% of the workforce. Latino demographics are slightly higher perhaps by a base point or two. Asians account for roughly 7-8% I believe. 

While you will see minorities scattered throughout the organization, the reality that few of them achieve leadership success within the organization is certainly true. For women of color, especially Black women of color, the harsh reality is even fewer achieve leadership success despite many of them having stellar performance reviews and tenured experience. 

Retention for women and minorities is even more of a joke. Countless number of women and minorities are leaving the company because of the cis white male hegemony present within the organization.","Do yourself a favor - proactively recruit and retain more women and people of color. Provide more opportunities to those who do not fit the majority mold yet who consistently provide quality work. 

Stop promoting solely on the basis of whether or not you like someone and focus on who can bring true value and impact to your organization.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

The work from home capabilities are decent. You can wear whatever you want. Literally. Before I joined I thought BB was a stiff-necked cross between a bank and hedge fund. Nope. I was happily mistaken. They have fresh fruit, free soup, tons of coffee, and snacks for free - daily. Oh, and every office is littered with tons of exotic salt & fresh water tanks.

- Though organization chart looks very flat for entry level analyst, people with different skills can propose and work on totally different projects that make best use of their skills
- There are three streams of speciality /skills that are looked upon in this role. First type of people are ""good"" at tech: which is anonymous to VBA (shifting to python gradually), SQL , R and statistical analysis etc. The second type ""knows"" the market and collaborates with some other departments internally to publish data driven news articles. Third type are more finance or business driven, who helps with the top line and client engagement pre or post sale.","Cons are mainly for the role itself.
- Hiring is not role specific for fresh/recent graduates to the entry level analyst position. Under the same umbrella of the global data department, the nature of work can be quite different for different teams. However, this assignment was not made known to the new hires until their first day or even later.
- Most of the daily work is based on the Bloomberg terminal and some internal softwares and highly repetitive, which makes the knowledge of knowing a lot of nuances and judgement of knowing what data is wrong/correct not transferable to the next job
- The role should be best described as ""Data operations analyst"" or ""Data management analyst"" ( not ""Global Data Analyst"" or ""Market Analyst"" as that does not reflect the nature of the responsibilities). As such, I do not see a long-term fit of any of the above 3 types of people if they are ambitious in further developing their (emphasis: transferable) skills through work experience.
- A lot of so-called projects are exact duplicates, but people in different regions just keep on working on their localized ""projects"" even if it has already been done elsewhere.

Wed Oct 31 2018 11:52:01 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),,,Current Employee ,"Bloomberg Intelligence: Great team, great product (but not for sheep)",I have been working at Bloomberg L.P. full-time,6,"I’ve worked at Bloomberg Intelligence long enough to know the future here is far brighter than stuck in a broken bulge-bracket boiler room (do you remember the heyday - when the buyside trusted their views, Associates loved their jobs and Analysts didn’t live layoff-to-layoff? Then you are alone...). Like most of my senior colleagues, I was a successful Analyst at a traditional research shop you‘d know. Here I have more client access, more access to companies and experts, and more resources to build my franchise. It would take a true lack of vision to ever go back.

I decided to write this after reading several narrow-minded nuggets, lobbed into this forum by some grumpy elves (so scarce at BI, most of us can guess who). I hope I can offer some balance, and not sound promotional because, frankly, working here is pretty good. I’ve taken enough interviews to know I have good options, and seen a few peers leave for seats they really wanted. To me, BI is the best place to be.

I’d also like to counter some of the unfair baloney leveled at management. I’m not a manager, but their fairness and vision is a key reason that I joined and that I stay. Know any “leaders” you’d follow among those still squeezing pennies out of sellside sweatshops? Ours have the honesty to see the legacy biases, vision to shape a novel product, and guts to get started.

The BI product is fun to write and powerful to read because a generalist can quickly engage it, an expert can dive deep, it is soaked in data and it is modular in a way that brings the right analyst’s voice into the right part of any report. Imagine writing a detailed research piece, but knowing your peers would link your best paragraphs right into their own work – and that you’d better recheck it often, because the graphs are live!

As an Associate, the pieces we author on industry basic concepts and indicators will be yours to write sooner than anywhere else. You’ll build company models experienced buysiders use to actually make decisions (not ones designed to play the “call me, I’m far out of consensus!” game)

You’ll also battle a bunch of weird new technology systems, and always wonder that the “rules” are! Why? Because, this is NOT an ancient financial house where a bunch of well-connected jerks rig rules to make sure you can’t get your full bonus or take their cushy job. This IS a (well-funded) startup, where quickly making anything new or cool clients want comes before designing a clear, simple career path for you and us. But, as always in life, uncertainty comes with benefits.

As an Associate, us Analysts will actually teach you to pick up coverage. We are growing, we have a lot more to cover and we don’t have to defend ourselves against your career progress! Oh, and we’ll let you have time to have a life at the end of the day. Oh, and you’ll actually make some friends, because it isn’t “you or them” in the next round of inevitable layoffs (see history of “real research” shops). Oh, and the top-to-bottom pay disparity here is FAR narrower than any I’ve seen on the street. Oh, and you’ll get to work at Bloomberg – where people are much happier overall than most places.

As an Analyst, you either already see why this is a great place – or not. In the latter case I’d probably respect you, but not want to work with you. I came here for novelty and innovation and to be with colleagues who were also uninspired by the bare-knuckles battle down the old-school path. Frankly, I’ve been paid well enough that I’m still glad I took the risk. Best of luck with MiFID 2!","It's tough to balance the stable research product clients expect, against the fast technology change expected within an innovator like Bloomberg.

Most senior devs have been in the company since college and haven’t learned anything new about the world of coding for years. It is tough when your team lead is both a friendly person but also hasn’t heard of basic coding tools, like `curl`.

I have friends who entered the company with me just a year or so ago out of college and spend most of their time writing fortran. (If you don’t know what fortran is, and you’re under 40, that’s probably a good thing.) Bloomberg Terminal frontend apps are written in an esoteric javascript framework called Rapid, which is a major headache and won’t help you build skills in any modern frontend framework.

Bloomberg is a good first job out of college in that you get a great pay and great benefits and can use that to establish yourself in a new city (probably nyc) and save up some money / pay off loans.

You can your time here to try to build up your tech skills or study for the CFA. 

Take the offer if you have contacts already in Global data that can honestly tell you about the team that the company want to place you in - it's a complete hit or miss and you want to make sure you don't get stuck for 18 months on a useless team wasting your time.","I mentioned they bring in a fresh batch of kids in every few months - There's a reason for that. The turnover is incredibly high and the reasons for these have been stated lengthily in the other reviews. 
Probably about 75% of the data teams are complete BS. Most of your job will be manually tagging data day in and day out cranking out work items. Then you will be assigned a block of time where you have to do troubleshooting for clients and their questions. Nobody can escape this, everyone who is an analyst has to do this. It can be manageable if you are on a big team where you might be assigned to do this once a week for a few hours to doing it multiple hours a day. The actual ""data analysis"" works probably comprises of a small part of your day unless you are an extremely motivated individual who stays in the office for an extra 10 hours a week to do these projects on your own. 

It is crucial that you find contacts within global data that can give you an honest picture of the data team that you get the offer for. There are some very good teams that are working on exciting projects under talented managers and if you get onto those teams then this should be an auto accept. 

One of the other things is that it is an unfortunate cycle where the talented folks quickly learn that they either got stiffed by a bad team/manager, or reached a professional/educational growth ceiling in their role. Since the management structure is extremely flat, these folks leave within 1-3 years. Because of this, the middle of the road analysts stay and end up becoming horrible managers. There are of course some amazing managers, but this is the exception not the rule.","You have this amazing company that gives an incredible amount of pay and benefits but you have this horrible turnover and you ask yourself why?

This is why - its 2018 - bring all your systems up to date. Dont hire rocket scientists with masters degrees to do manual data entry all day long. They will get bored out of their minds and leave no matter how good of an offer you give them. These these can and should be automated. 
Break up the old boys club and integrate global data with engineering teams more to speed up automation. The sooner you can get people off doing manual data entry and doing actual analysis, you will see your retention shoot up overnight.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

A very small number of talented and ambitious individuals in the division who are willing to work hard and create value for clients, but unfortunately they are ignored and demonized for any attempt to question the direction of the division and conduct insightful research. They deserve better.","This is a review I found on glassdoor that i felt ENTIRELY represents the reality of BI, and so I felt it was more than appropriate to quote it here. I URGE you to read this in its entirety if you are thinking about joining BI:

""The owner of Bloomberg L.P. famously said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention: “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!” ….sadly there is a con job going on within his business, right under his nose, within his Bloomberg Intelligence department (internally referred to as BI, externally by clients as BS) and he appears to be completely oblivious to it...

The Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) mission, sadly, seems to be destroying the hard earned reputation of Bloomberg L.P.’s owner and Analysts/Associates who work for the department through the combination of sheer management incompetence and deceitful practices.

How is BI Management accomplishing this mission?

Bloomberg Intelligence writes BITs (Bloomberg Industry Thoughts) or commonly referred to internally by everyone in the department as “SPAM”. Each BIT is about 2 tweets long (~500 characters)…these BITs are strung together to create the Wall Street's shallowest and most backward looking “research” product, the quality of which is multiples worst than Seeking Alpha and not even remotely comparable to traditional sell-side research.

Two primary products are produced: Primers (reworded investor presentations which are portrayed as insight) and ‘Best’ Ideas (any old semi-coherent, half-baked, or ill-formed notion). An Analyst’s research quality is judged solely based on their initial compensation level (not the actual research they produce) and pay bands are extremely wide ($125K to $800K per year for nearly identical roles). BI Management refers to this pay scheme as a meritocracy, but it is literally the diametric opposite. This logic ensures that where you begin in terms of compensation within BI is where you end -- irrespective of the quality of research produced. This practice ensures mediocre research is the norm and persists because there is zero incentive to produce high quality work.

The highest compensated Analysts in the department have Associates, recent college graduates who write BITs and work on their behalf. Given that the quality of the 'research' does not matter, this setup enables the highest paid analysts to do very little, if any, analytical work and effectively arbitrage of the wide pay differentials between Analysts and Associates (who earn less than $125K per year). Bloomberg L.P. is paying some Analysts $600K+ while they outsource the vast majority of the work to recent college graduates. BI Management refers to this practice as a ""perk"" of seniority, which decoded means that so long as you don't blow the whistle on them - they are happy to let some Analysts not earn their compensation. In fact, what BI Management is effectively doing is buying the silence of their most senior Analysts.

There is a quota for BITs that must be produced (20+ weekly), which primarily consist of Primers (20+ companies, 10 BITs minimum each, refreshed quarterly), Best Ideas (2 monthly, about 6 bits each), and other random pieces of information (the plug). This framework created by BI Management creates a never-ending treadmill of low value BITs/”research” that clients don’t find useful. This is evidenced by the lack of traction and engagement with clients despite having the best distribution system on Wall Street - the Bloomberg Terminal. Analysts are routinely encouraged to put in fake PROs notes (the internal system to track client engagement) to hide this fact - a simple review of what merits a PROs note for BI would uncover this. Just compare a Sales PROs note to one produced by BI to see first hand the level of deception.

BI’s key internal metric is “hits” (research views, not research quality) and this metric is routinely gamed by BI Management. The primary means of gaming the metric are through “clickbait” headlines and counting a BIT as a “hit” even if a client spends literally only 2 seconds on it. In other words, if a client clicks on a headline and then immediately exits the BIT, BI considers this “client engagement” -- this is the vast majority of research views/hits. The combination of these business practices enables BI Management to show they are taking share on the Terminal by creating increasing amounts of spam largely at the expense of the legitimate news department and in the process make the Terminal less useful. Clients are so revolted by BI that they regularly ask Sales how to block BI's content.

In addition to BIT writing, Analysts are also expected to serve as pundits on TV, present at conferences, develop deep relationships with counterparts at covered companies, as well as speak to and visit with clients. Given the extreme low quality of the product produced by the BIT treadmill, companies and clients largely ignore BI because they do not consider the department a credible research provider. BI Analysts only speak at 4th Tier conferences...the ones who frankly can’t get anyone else. Truth be told, most clients think BI Analysts are reporters. BI’s management then represents to the Board of Directors that BI is comparable to Top Tier sell-side shops like JP Morgan….this notion is beyond laughable. Bloomberg Intelligence is provided free to terminal clients and clients are getting what they paid for.

Analysts and Associates are leaving BI in droves even if it means taking a step backwards in their careers and accepting lower pay - this fact alone tells you all you need to know about the department. Turnover in the department is in excess of 25%. BI Management spins this number to the Board of Directors and HR by telling them falsehoods, namely that as BI’s profile increases Analyst and Associates are getting “picked off” by the Street. This is a straight up lie and highlights the character and integrity of BI Management. People are voting with their feet and the turnover rate is reflective of the complete lack of confidence BI management and the product they have created.

BI Management’s primary business strategy is ‘putting lipstick on a pig’. Given the extremely low quality of the product BI’s management have created, this approach is logical. Helping execute this strategy are Directors of Research and Team Leaders. Their aim is to strong arm subordinates into submission like the prison guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment. The qualities required to be a Director of Research or Team Leader are straightforward -- lack of research ability and empathy for the people they lead and most importantly a willingness to continue BI Managements organizational deceit without any questions. In short, these are people who lack a back-bone and enable Bloomberg LP to continue being conned….and for this, they are richly compensated by BI Management. Management is aware that Directors of Research and Team Leaders are unemployable outside of BI...and effectively pay them to perpetuate the scheme...

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that Bloomberg can not solve the problems in its Intelligence department with the same level of thinking that created them. Most in the department expect Bloomberg’s Board of Directors to eventually axe BI’s entire management team if not the whole department when they figure out the reputational damage BI has caused.

The owner of Bloomberg L.P. and potential 2020 presidential candidate has proclaimed “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!”...So long as BI persists in its current form, sadly this statement should be viewed as false.""","Advice to the owner of Bloomberg L.P. and the Board of Directors....first fire BI management...then answer the question ""How was this organizational deceit allowed to occur for so long?""",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

Fri Sep 28 2018 13:41:04 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Analyst,,Current Employee ,Bloomberg Intelligence Equals Reputation Risk & Organizational Deceit,I have been working at Bloomberg L.P. full-time,20,Free food and healthcare plan,"The owner of Bloomberg L.P. famously said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention: “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!” ….sadly there is a con job going on within his business, right under his nose, within his Bloomberg Intelligence department (internally referred to as BI, externally by clients as BS) and he appears to be completely oblivious to it...

The Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) mission, sadly, seems to be destroying the hard earned reputation of Bloomberg L.P.’s owner and Analysts/Associates who work for the department through the combination of sheer management incompetence and deceitful practices.

How is BI Management accomplishing this mission? 

Bloomberg Intelligence writes BITs (Bloomberg Industry Thoughts) or commonly referred to internally by everyone in the department as “SPAM”. Each BIT is about 2 tweets long (~500 characters)…these BITs are strung together to create the Wall Street's shallowest and most backward looking “research” product, the quality of which is multiples worst than Seeking Alpha and not even remotely comparable to traditional sell-side research.

Two primary products are produced: Primers (reworded investor presentations which are portrayed as insight) and ‘Best’ Ideas (any old semi-coherent, half-baked, or ill-formed notion). An Analyst’s research quality is judged solely based on their initial compensation level (not the actual research they produce) and pay bands are extremely wide ($125K to $800K per year for nearly identical roles). BI Management refers to this pay scheme as a meritocracy, but it is literally the diametric opposite. This logic ensures that where you begin in terms of compensation within BI is where you end -- irrespective of the quality of research produced. This practice ensures mediocre research is the norm and persists because there is zero incentive to produce high quality work. 

The highest compensated Analysts in the department have Associates, recent college graduates who write BITs and work on their behalf. Given that the quality of the 'research' does not matter, this setup enables the highest paid analysts to do very little, if any, analytical work and effectively arbitrage of the wide pay differentials between Analysts and Associates (who earn less than $125K per year). Bloomberg L.P. is paying some Analysts $600K+ while they outsource the vast majority of the work to recent college graduates. BI Management refers to this practice as a ""perk"" of seniority, which decoded means that so long as you don't blow the whistle on them - they are happy to let some Analysts not earn their compensation. In fact, what BI Management is effectively doing is buying the silence of their most senior Analysts.

There is a quota for BITs that must be produced (20+ weekly), which primarily consist of Primers (20+ companies, 10 BITs minimum each, refreshed quarterly), Best Ideas (2 monthly, about 6 bits each), and other random pieces of information (the plug). This framework created by BI Management creates a never-ending treadmill of low value BITs/”research” that clients don’t find useful. This is evidenced by the lack of traction and engagement with clients despite having the best distribution system on Wall Street - the Bloomberg Terminal. Analysts are routinely encouraged to put in fake PROs notes (the internal system to track client engagement) to hide this fact - a simple review of what merits a PROs note for BI would uncover this. Just compare a Sales PROs note to one produced by BI to see first hand the level of deception.

BI’s key internal metric is “hits” (research views, not research quality) and this metric is routinely gamed by BI Management. The primary means of gaming the metric are through “clickbait” headlines and counting a BIT as a “hit” even if a client spends literally only 2 seconds on it. In other words, if a client clicks on a headline and then immediately exits the BIT, BI considers this “client engagement” -- this is the vast majority of research views/hits. The combination of these business practices enables BI Management to show they are taking share on the Terminal by creating increasing amounts of spam largely at the expense of the legitimate news department and in the process make the Terminal less useful. Clients are so revolted by BI that they regularly ask Sales how to block BI's content.

In addition to BIT writing, Analysts are also expected to serve as pundits on TV, present at conferences, develop deep relationships with counterparts at covered companies, as well as speak to and visit with clients. Given the extreme low quality of the product produced by the BIT treadmill, companies and clients largely ignore BI because they do not consider the department a credible research provider. BI Analysts only speak at 4th Tier conferences...the ones who frankly can’t get anyone else. Truth be told, most clients think BI Analysts are reporters. BI’s management then represents to the Board of Directors that BI is comparable to Top Tier sell-side shops like JP Morgan….this notion is beyond laughable. Bloomberg Intelligence is provided free to terminal clients and clients are getting what they paid for. 

Analysts and Associates are leaving BI in droves even if it means taking a step backwards in their careers and accepting lower pay - this fact alone tells you all you need to know about the department. Turnover in the department is in excess of 25%. BI Management spins this number to the Board of Directors and HR by telling them falsehoods, namely that as BI’s profile increases Analyst and Associates are getting “picked off” by the Street. This is a straight up lie and highlights the character and integrity of BI Management. People are voting with their feet and the turnover rate is reflective of the complete lack of confidence BI management and the product they have created.

BI Management’s primary business strategy is ‘putting lipstick on a pig’. Given the extremely low quality of the product BI’s management have created, this approach is logical. Helping execute this strategy are Directors of Research and Team Leaders. Their aim is to strong arm subordinates into submission like the prison guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment. The qualities required to be a Director of Research or Team Leader are straightforward -- lack of research ability and empathy for the people they lead and most importantly a willingness to continue BI Managements organizational deceit without any questions. In short, these are people who lack a back-bone and enable Bloomberg LP to continue being conned….and for this, they are richly compensated by BI Management. Management is aware that Directors of Research and Team Leaders are unemployable outside of BI...and effectively pay them to perpetuate the scheme... 

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that Bloomberg can not solve the problems in its Intelligence department with the same level of thinking that created them. Most in the department expect Bloomberg’s Board of Directors to eventually axe BI’s entire management team if not the whole department when they figure out the reputational damage BI has caused.

The owner of Bloomberg L.P. and potential 2020 presidential candidate has proclaimed “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!”...So long as BI persists in its current form, sadly this statement should be viewed as false.","Advice to the owner of Bloomberg L.P. and the Board of Directors....first fire BI management...then answer the question ""How was this organizational deceit allowed to occur for so long?""",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

- Unique client base

- Philanthropy"," Sales and analytics groups are miserable to work in mostly because of management.
- Management is inflexible and in many cases incompetent and ignorant. 
-Most middle managers delegate their work to their already overworked subordinates.
- High turnover throughout the company, its a revolving door. People are constantly leaving because they are unhappy or being pushed out by management because they are not liked (even if you're performing).
- Most of the people who enter analytics will only have one career path, sales, which is also becoming miserable.
- Company reorganizes itself every 6-8 months. This is exhausting, its like as soon as you get really good at doing something its time to change it up in terms of company direction, focus, metrics and teams.
- No motivation/incentive to work beyond 8-5. Bonus is nothing to incentivize employees. Constant micromanagement.
- Huge focus on ineffective cold and warm calling. Its all about numbers. The calls you make will insult your intelligence and they are annoying the client base. This is done so management can make itself seem productive to senior management.
- You are under a microscope. They read your chats and emails. You feel like you can not take bathroom or coffee breaks. If you're going to be 2 minutes late, better email your manager.
- Management doesn't know how to staff support que's so everyone is always extremely stressed and at capacity. Majority of analytics does not have confidence and feels like they are constantly walking on egg shells.
- Purely a customer support role. Not an analyst or finance role. Almost everyone in the department would leave if they could.
- Nothing is transparent despite having the ability to see so many metrics for yourself and peers.

Let's start with the work environment. The offices are some of the nicest, tech friendly offices in the New York City. The 731 Lexington Ave location is always buzzing with energy. Most people are very friendly and approachable, and the company encourages collaboration accross departments. 

Next, the benefits and perks of working there are amazing. Free health insurance (given passing a biometric screening), great time off & sick pay, free snacks & coffee 24/7 and lots of other great perks. 

Learning opportunities are abundant at Bloomberg. They provide loads of in-house training, as well as tuition reimbursement for graduate school as well as financial designations.

Career advancement is a HUGE issue at Bloomberg. The flat hierarchical structure lends itself to many employees leaving the firm to advance their career, or taking on laterall moves that ultimately do not fulfill their desires for advancement. 

Amazing benefits do come at one clear cost - below average compensation packages. They tend to start out new hires at superior salaries, but over time the growth just is not there and after a few years you will lag behind the industry. 

Lots of politics and engineering has WAY too much control. Product managers should be driving engineering, not the other way around.
