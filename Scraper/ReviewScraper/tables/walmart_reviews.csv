Mon Sep 23 2019 20:40:07 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Category Specialist,"San Bruno, CA",Current Employee ,Love-Hate Relationship,I have been working at Walmart eCommerce full-time for more than a year,3," Young environment w/ tons of other Category Specialists who've graduated within 1-3 years ago. This is great if you're new to SF and want to make friends w/ co-workers. - Unlimited PTO... but flexibility of PTO really depends on your manager and how well you perform as an associate. However, I've seen that as long as you give a month or more notice of a longer PTO (~2 weeks), and it's not during peak seasons like holiday, then you should feel comfortable asking your manager for time-off. - Kind, relaxed environment. General vibe of associates is pretty sociable, chill, and kind. Based on the other tech shuttles I've seen, Walmart associates definitely look a little less nerdy and tend to dress well. Despite there being lots of highly educated CSs from Ivies and other top schools, no one comes off as overtly competitive or socially awkward. I would say the company has a social environment. It's normal for CSs to hang out during weekends, go on weekend trips, and actually become close friends. Some teams are closer than others. Some teams are more competitive than others. It really depends where you end up getting placed. - Free fitness classes. I've taken the 3C class since I started working at Walmart.com. It's a really great workout class, offered multiple times a week. It's taught by an Equinox trainer."," Does not offer as many perks as other tech companies. No free food, only occasional free snacks. No company sponsored events except for Day at the Ballpark that comes once a year. No company holiday party. Once a month, we have an in-office Happy Hour. - Fires associates with little warning. Two associates on my team have been fired within the last 8 months. It's abrupt, and the rest of the team is left wondering why our co-worker has been let go. There's no explanation, and you can't ask because it's awkward, and the manager tells us that there's not much they can disclose. - You must go above and beyond to ""Meet Expectations"" during annual performance. Others on my team have struggled to even get ""Meets Expectations"". Managers say that doing what is required of you is not enough, and you must go beyond your role to meet or exceed. - No say in which category you get placed. After a year, you can request to transfer categories. But even so, it's difficult to move outside of your super-department. For instance, if you're in Home and want to be in Entertainment, it's recommended that you stay within Home. - Personal bias in performance reviews. My manager seems to have a personal bias that affects his/her judgement when it comes to firing or promoting associates on the team. I'm making this assumption based on the fact that two associates on my team got fired, for no outright fireable offenses. However, it was known that my manager did not seem to like these associates as much. Though I will admit these associates weren't as strong as others, they still did their jobs and were intelligent. What bothers me is that I talked to them both after the incidents, and they were both very shocked about what happened. One of them even said that in his/her last review, he/she got the feedback that he/she was improving. And I think if they were on a less strict team with a different manager, they would have been fine. This manager has also promoted others on my team quickly, quicker than what I think is fair. I was promoted as well, but I put in more time and helped trained the people who got promoted. The lack of transparency about firings and promotions among team members is discouraging. I'd like to trust my manager and believe that he/she is doing the right thing, but it's hard to do so with such little information about the reason behind the actions. I also think my team is held to a higher standard than a lot of the bigger teams at the company. I wish I was on a different team. - Managers like BS. So far, it seems to me that if you're really good at shamelessly talking yourself up, you'll go far. A girl on my team isn't much of a team player. She doesn't do much for the team as a whole, but she's really great at doing her own work and speaks well about her financials. She's not someone I want to work with and doesn't add much value to the team on a personal level; whereas, I'm always there for others on my team, take time out of my day to show others how to do things, etc. Because of this, I have to work longer and get less done. She got promoted alongside me even though I helped train her, and she started after me. It's things like this that I'm learning that corporate mobility is about self-interest and who can brag the most.",,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0

People aren't encouraged to take lunch breaks and also aren't encouraged to leave at a reasonable hour. Most people eat at their desks and leave at 7pm on a good day.

Also, as stated in the reviews below the performance reviews are on a bell curve which makes everyone extremely competitive with eachother and honestly the feedback you get isn't even truly based on your category performance. Instead, it is based on if your manager likes you or not on a personal level. for the team I was on, it was SO obvious who the favorites were.

Toxic Review System. Tough Culture. High Turnover. The employee review process fosters a negative environment where sucking up is rewarded and employees have to campaign to grow. Reviews are not based on actual performance but based on who leaders are pushing forward for promotion each review round. All leaders discuss the candidates up for promotion and have to fight to get their associates promoted. This creates the suck up environment because associates campaign to get promoted with their leaders peers. This deters and takes away from the work. Great work and talent is not rewarded. Leaders say growth is owned by the associate. No accountability for fostering and building talent. This means there are no growth opportunities and leadership gives employees a ""figure it out yourself"" mentality. Being a ""yes man"" is rewarded, critical thinking and actually caring about the work and the end customer is completely disregarded. Top talent leaves because of this. Pay is not comparable to the tech industry at all. High turnover in leadership. Every 6 months the strategy changes due to new leaders. This isn't for innovation this is chaotic and all progress is set back because a new leader wants to prove themselves instead of evolving and building upon the successes that have been established. Leadership tries to say they operate like a startup, which is an excuse for a chaos and disorganization. This is Walmart, this is a well established brand with incredible brand DNA. STOP trying to sell it like it is something else and sell it for what it is, which is the longest standing, largest retailer in the world. Be proud of that. Managers are treated like entry level associates and are not given resources to elevate their work and continue to grow individually while impacting business and the customer experience to the most potential. Leadership continues to use budget to layer directly under themselves - Creating top heavy orgs. Bottom line everyone is so eager for their own growth they are failing to lift up and grow talent from the bottom up. Leaders don't actually want to manage people or do the work. Leaders will take credit for work and not give appropriate credit.

Sun Aug 26 2018 01:21:04 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Senior Software Engineer,"Sunnyvale, CA",Former Employee ,Toxic work culture,I worked at Walmart eCommerce full-time for more than a year,13,*Pays better than many other companies. *Udemy courses online are free ( not all but most) which is the only learning opportunity within the company,"* No parking * horrible food * unassigned seating, have to hunt for a desk every morning, chargers, headphones ,chairs and other accessories get stolen if left unattended at desk, specially if left overnight. *Extremely political, extremely tight coupling between teams which is totally unnecessary, forcing collaborative work. With collaborative work, it’s not always clear who has done what, which leaves the door open for a colleague or your manager to take undue credit for your work. * People expect to be spoon-fed in the name of collaborating and get promoted regardless. * Allegiance is held in higher regard than actual performance. *Open communication is held against you. *Nepotism is prevalent. *No on-boarding *No goal setting * HR seems to be non-existent, its well known that HR is meant to safe guard the company's interests in every company, but still, in other places they do have some tools to keep managers in check from abusing their power so blatantly. We are expected to give our manager's 360 feedback in a simple email that goes to our director. There is no forum to keep the feedback confidential. Anyone who raises concerns becomes the system's target. * positions are falsely advertised. When you actually join the job, job description may not match the actual work you are given. *1 on 1 / 1:1 are formalities, its mostly a one directional conversation, no matter what you have to say, its never acknowledged by your manager or HR. Even if you show solid evidence, they will game the system to set you up for failure for next time. * Health insurance is not that great. * Unlimited PTO creates a competition to take lesser time off in the team. You have to have leverage with your manager to negotiate for PTO, this often comes at the cost of long unpaid extra hours on weekends and after hours, or some other kind of favor. At the manager's whim, even a preplanned PTO can be expected to be cancelled at last moment, with serious repercussions if the employee resists. The system is very unfair.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

From the inside it's a different story.,"Extremely political, nepotism all around, quality is overlooked if you don't bow to your manager or director. Allegiance is held in higher regard than critical thinking. Open communication is frowned upon. Credentials, qualifications and experience are irrelevant as long as you're friend with the unit leaders or other cronies / puppets / minions. No development methodology, agile is a foreign concept, daily stand-ups are only ceremonial. The real work and progress relies on a few engineers on visa's, most product and program managers are accessories, almost ornamental. Systems to track features and stories are obsolete, no real sprint planning, no real sizing of features, no capacity planning, no real prioritization, no roadmaps, the pipeline is an abstract construct that is loosely defined, a black box. User and market research are completely unstructured , discussion or feedback is never welcome, very little tolerance to ponder new ideas other than those already set. Go to market is disorganized, no real strategy, no real plan, they wing it as they go. Bring many third parties to get stuff done in an incoherent manner but expecting stellar results. No budget or planning. Good luck trying to innovate and create amazing experiences, coming in and trying to look into customer loyalty you'll find literally walls when you talk to business stakeholders and executive level leaders, they'll throw around the EDLP or every day low prices company motto as gospel and you'll never get anywhere, you'll actually get blocked for the blasphemy. Mentality is entrenched in an old model that used to work 50 years ago but now prevents the company to evolve and compete with Amazon. Take for example the rudimentary breakdown of groceries and general merchandise that they currently have in their website, you can't put lettuce, eggs, and a toaster in your cart at the same time. Please ! Is this the way they're trying to ""integrate"" expensive brands like bonobos into the experience? Personalization is non-existent and the team is largely inexperienced, omni-channel is nothing but a mirage, order online and pickup in store is all they have and all there is. Analytics are underutilized, managers and directors couldn't care less about kpi's there's little understanding and even disregard of product data specially if it goes against one of the leaders in your team. No on-boarding for new team members, no goals setting by month or quarter, no retrospectives by sprint or quarter, no team goals alignment. Each team runs it's own way. Still you're expected to please your superior but if you don't you'll be shown the door, saw many instances of that, no reason, no discussion, just let people go, full timers and contractors alike.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

What they didn’t mention is that in reality, all the decisions are made by people higher up in the company, who often graduated from bottom tier schools like the University of Phoenix. The day to day of a category specialist can be summed up with one phrase: digital shelf stocking. It is literally like stocking shelves in a Walmart store, except online. You set up new items online by filling out extensive forms (tickets), remove items from the site, change out photos, and categorize items. It is as boring as it gets. To top it all off, many teams are very understaffed, with one category specialist doing the work of 10 category specialists. Despite all this heavy lifting, management is very hesitant to give out “exceeds expectations” reviews. I know many people who work hard and long hours and only “meet expectations” on their evaluations. Most importantly, there is virtually no structured training for the job. They give you a mere two weeks of training, where literally none of the dozens of outdated systems are taught to the new hires. Category specialists are thrown head first into the work environment, in which most low level managers don’t even know how to use the systems. New hires are expected to learn quickly from fellow employees, who often themselves don’t know what to do and are drowning in work.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

Instead, they just want the revenue and the smart people they've hired or acquired to keep their mouths shut and to smile and nod and to be grateful they part of Walmart.

Walmart has been hiring tons of category specialist and will continue to. The problem is there is no clear answer about what the path of the category specialist is. The company really needs to figure what they are going to do with category specialist soon. Another major problem is that category specialist are being hired for the same job but different category specialist are paid (starting salaries) at different levels even though we all do the same job. Just know that you can being the same job as someone else with the same title and being paid less. Also big con is that it seems like Walmart is having a hard time hiring as many category specialist as they want so new hires are being paid more than those category specialist with almost a year of Walmart experience.

When I was first hired, I was truly excited for the direction the company was going in to compete with Amazon. Aside from a smooth, yet misleading interview process, my entire experience thus far has been very unsatisfactory and has me looking to get out ASAP. Pay & Benefits-- For starters, if you apply to a Category Management role in the SF Bay Area, you will not be compensated for your market worth and will definitely be underpaid. The recruiters make it seem like the 10k bonus (or rather 6k bonus, after taxes) is a selling point-- don't let that fool you. In addition, you would think the benefits would help offset the lower salary, but that is definitely not the case. I know this may sound arrogant and a bit entitled, but when you're a company that makes millions in hours and you're also competing for top talent with Amazon, let alone in the Bay Area, you've got to step your game up. Culture-- Aside from mediocre pay and benefits, the office culture reeks of bureaucracy, politics, rigidness, and saps one of any energy and drive. It seems like most people are content and just going through the motions, while others are trying to turn Walmart into something its not-- an actually innovative and forward thinking company. Walmart's biggest selling point is that you get the experience of both a start up and big company-- but from my experience, any attempt at innovating, challenging the status quo, or simply lobbying to get projects worked on (because everything has to be approved by a director, director's director, VP, and so forth) makes it extremely difficult ""to move with speed"", ""agility"", or ""change the way we work""-- nothing but fictional words and phrases used to create the allure of a company that wants to be considered in the same league as its competitors. Management- During my time with the company, I've reported to 3 different managers- some better than others, but for the most part, management seems to lack the emotional intelligence/people skills required to develop and retain employees. I've never been in such a hierarchical-based company. At other companies I've worked for, even directors and leaders that your manager reports to would make time to hear your perspective and develop you. At Walmart, your manager is the only person who really gets to communicate to leadership about your progress, thus if you don't agree with everything your manager says, you are seen as being defiant or ""not performing well"".",,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

There is no respect for the individual, and work/life balance is not supported. This leadership team has created an almost hostile work environment and unfortunately, few people are willing to give feedback for fear of retaliation.
