Mon Jun 24 2019 13:28:33 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Software Engineer,"Palo Alto, CA",Former Employee ,Great place to work that values quality of life and family,I worked at VMware full-time for more than 8 years,50,"VMware is a big company but in many ways had a startup vibe. That was great because the resources and infrastructure of a big company were there, but it gave most people I worked with freedom to work on many projects, influence, move around, and contribute in many ways. Plus, many things moved faster than they might at other companies of the same size. Perks were really great including bonuses, events on the campus, opportunities, etc.","The biggest con is the annual layoff. During most of the years I was there, we were growing like crazy, beating expectations, gaining in stock price, etc. It was always positive and upward. However, every single January, it was known that there would be a round of layoffs, even when all numbers were looking great as they almost always were. Management called it restructuring. But, over the years, some really good people were let go for no apparent reason. Then to add insult to injury, a week or two later, there would be a company quarterly meeting discussing how VMware was doing so well and is still hiring, but they had to make some changes. It always felt dishonest and the sympathy for those let go came across as disingenuous.",January was always a nerve racking month and it completely destroyed any sense of loyalty to the company. I know a few people that completely changed their perception of VMware after a colleague of theirs was let go with no apparent rhyme or reason. Many people left shortly after as a result of losing loyalty to the company or for just being stressed out about themselves getting cut the next year.,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0

Sun Sep 15 2019 13:47:47 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Principal Architect,"Palo Alto, CA",Former Employee ,Best place I have ever worked,I worked at VMware full-time for more than 5 years,11,"VMware is a much loved brand, with a massive community following in the industry. The premises (see what I did there) at Palo Alto HQ is a joyful place to work. There are several restaurants onsite, with coffee, ice cream, and every building has at least one kitchen stocked with soda, espresso machines, healthy and unhealthy snacks, peanut butter, bread, fruit, you name it. Over the years I have brought my family here to see the turtles, watch seasonal events that they throw, and even feed the turtles.

As for the technology, VMware have there staple diet of vSphere, but don't be fooled into thinking this is still just a virtualization company. With acquisitions such as Nicera that made NSX possible, and features such as vSAN, their staple diet is strong. Over recent years they have brought in some amazing talent, and the technical leadership is second to none. I'm talking about Chris Wolf, Joe Baguley, Bruce Davie, Christos Karamanolis, and Kit Colbert just to name a few.

What makes VMware successful today isn't just their core vSphere platform, but their ability to run it successfully in the public cloud (AWS, Google, Azure) and now bring in containers. I should also mention that in my day to day interactions with customers, other lesser known products such as vRealize Operations, Automation, Orchestrator, vCloud Director and Log Insight mean this is truly a world-class enterprise solution.

I know that many of you will be thinking I am talking like a 'fan boi', well maybe, but you must realize (pun intended) that this is the heart of what VMware is about. There is a real passion, especially among the technical engineering BUs, including the field (PSO, SE), for what VMware is about.

Pat Gelsinger was voted #1 CEO, and during my time there I had personally received emails from him in response to feedback I gave. There are not many other companies with over 22,000 employees that get this level of attention. He is also extremely committed to the community I was talking about. At VMworld this year (2019) he was at two community events in person, talking with both employees and customers.

During my time at VMware I worked in two countries, across 3 different business units, and what a ride.","Like any company there are some bad people, however I still hope this is the minority at VMware.

Unfortunately it was the actions of one particular individual which led me to leave the company. My successful trajectory came to a sudden stop due to this person. My manager.","Read my cons above. I actually took this particular issue to senior (VP level) leadership. While I felt supported and was offered an alternative team to work with, no action was taken on this person. Nothing at all. I didn't even know if (or how) there was a process to report this to HR without logging an internal ticket, and I feared he would see it.

Please look after your most talented staff, and watch for bad management. Remember, people don't leave companies, they leave managers.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

I've only been here a few months, but they are very understanding of my career change and are helping me learn the ropes and the company as time goes by (even though they were very busy when I first started with many things going on, so I appreciate their help!). 

I get to work from home as much as I want and have yet to take any PTO, but the unlimited PTO option is pretty cool and I look forward to utilizing that in the future when I need to. Orientation was AWESOME, and I learned so many soft skills I didn't even realize I was lacking. This company really seems to care about culture and treating employees with respect. I look forward to using the skills they taught me to help the company in keeping to their high standards. 

It seems from other reviews that managers can make or break your time here. So far my managers and teammates have been nothing less than stellar and just so cool, so I feel my time here will continue to be a 5 star rating. I'm excited to keep learning and honing my skills and giving the best work possible.

The interview process for my position was grueling but honestly I feel in hindsight it was a pro. It really helped to encourage me that my skills were up to par with what they were looking for.","Orientation didn't happen until 3 months after I was hired. Felt very lost as to who and what VMware was exactly, and still am not entirely sure what the different softwares I'm working on are about (I don't come from a tech background).

I'm sure with time this will get easier though.",I feel there could definitely be a better on-boarding process for newbies.

Work/Life Balance, Upward Mobility, Cross Training or any career advancement is only existent if you have a manager and leadership team that will advocate on behalf of you and celebrate your accomplishments. Advocating on behalf of yourself only goes so far when BU management has their favorites.

EPIC Values is a joke and no one is actually held accountable to them. Vmware doesn't have a formal review process which is problematic because your manager is not obligated to communicate in a constructive way room for improvement/celebrate achievements. 

VMware has a LOT of work to do to actually give the representation they strive for outsiders to perceive. Lots of senior leaders that only employ people brought over from their previous companies with aged experience which ultimately stunts innovation and creativity. 

Younger employees are perceived as inexperienced and lacking knowledge. Someone has to either die or leave the company for you to be promoted. Sad because there are actual employees that are invested in the organization but don't have to the opportunity to innovate and make a change. And internal transfers are a joke - an external hire will be given the opportunity first, every time. 

So much for a ""career journey"" within the company. This is contributed to the fact that 90% of the recruiters at VMware are contractors and are not invested in the company and could care less about the candidate recruiting experience, even with an employee referral.

Excellent product portfolio.
Excellent CEO.

 Pat Gelsinger the CEO has done an awesome job of taking over the reigns of the company a few years ago and completely turning it around. The stock price has more than quadrupled under his leadership. He has acquired many startups and successfully integrated them into the VMWare product portfolio and eco system. Hats off to him for creating wealth for the employees, for the owners (EMC and now DELL) and for the investors. One of the finest CEO in the Silicon Valley.","Along with these product acquisitions, this company has also acquired managers and middle management who have no idea of what management is. There is no one culture at VMWare. There are as many cultures as the number of startups acquired and the managers of these startups are free to treat their teams as they want. HR is very weak in this company and they are not for you. They are for the managers ... dont rely on them. 

I had a short stint at one of these acquired startups called Velocloud. Incompetent management, very high attrition rate. Lot of senior engineers leaving the group. Those who stick around are there to vest their stocks. The founders thinks of themselves to be semi god who will punish you if you decide to leave their kingdom. Their technology stack will teach you nothing. Accept their offer if you cannot find a job somewhere else.

Most of these startup managers lack sympathy and empathy and will not hesitate to show you their powers and make you feel that you are a POS compared to them.

Dont be fooled by the ""100 Best Companies to Work"" or ""Top paying company"" marketing or the campus. It is actually an average paying and a very weak middle management company. Shop around, I am confident you will get a much better offer and a lot better culture, work environment and work life balance. I know people who were offered twice the package they were making at VMWare.",Pat: VMWare is doing an awesome job and will continue to do so under your excellent leadership. Fix the culture and HR of this company. Let HR be for the engineers also and not just for the managers.,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

Pay and benefits are top notch.","The rate of organizational change is overwhelming. I'm on my fifth boss in less than three years. The one who hired me was simply excellent, and was one of the best bosses I ever had. Sadly, the last three were among the bottom 10% of all my bosses. 

My current boss does not respond to phone calls or emails, and no one is able to schedule meetings with her on a timely basis. When she does finally meet with us, she does 90% of the talking, most of which is merely a re-hash of what she knows about the situation but with no new insight or leadership provided. Essentially, she is all talk, and has developed a reputation among other executives as being uncooperative and just doing things on her own.

Finally, there is too much internal competition and politics where there should be teamwork and cooperation. People view it as a badge of honor if they do someone else's job, causing total chaos.

Number two: ask for academic and professional qualification and experience. Shameful that “friends” hired can barely communicate on their own language and show little to no understand about professionalism in the workplace

My observation was that the managers friends would be given time off, flexible schedule, long vacations abroad (talking about 2 to 3 months) using the company time because the manager, while others were not allowed to even use sick time.

Parking lots are empty at 4:30 or 5:00 PM. and folks come in to work not before 10:00 AM in the morning.

Industry leading salaries and bonus (but very poor RSUs). The company moves at a reasonable pace and is very family friendly. 

The office location and campus for the HQ is awesome. 

The benefits and perks are also very good. 

The CEO and his team look to be very competent and genuinely nice people. 

The company has a compelling story with VMC on AWS. Hopefully it delivers on that vision or else the company is in for some real tough times.","On-prem enterprise software is not a cool technology sector to be in. 

Because of this perception the company does not attract the best talent anymore. Most of the A level players have left from the engineering ranks to startups or the FANG companies. So co-workers are mediocre at best.

Also the company moves at a glacial pace, compared to all the companies working in the cloud - releases in VMware take months to a year. 

 Its anachronistic in this day and age to have a monolithic technology stack. But with such a large installed base it will be near impossible for the company to pivot. 

Due to all of the above constraints it is hard to get excited about the technology in the company. 

A lot of the upper management are from the traditional old companies like Cisco, HP and IBM. This does not inspire confidence in the middle management.

The company pays well on the salary and bonus front but the RSU's are significantly lower than what FANG pays. 

Bottom line VMware is no longer a premium destination for employees. Its more in the same league as a Cisco or Oracle. A tier 3 company at best.
