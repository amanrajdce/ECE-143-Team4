Used to be my dream job. Now it’s just a job. Plan to retire in a few years or else I’d been running for the door. We used to chase Oracle (the enemy). With all the former ORCL leadership that has joined SFSC we have become the enemy. Senior sales management has little respect from the sales teams. They manage up, make you fabricate false forecasts, belittle you, treat you like chattel. Some execs have multiple harassment issues filed with HR, yet they not only remain they are promoted. I once called HR for the potential need for a FMLA and was informed that Salesforce was an “employment at will” company. Seriously, where’s the Ohana. Fortunately I didn’t require the FMLA.

Of course those instructions need to come from the leadership which this company lacks.","If you really call yourself a global company and believe in the term OHANA, then leadership should give the employees the freedom to telecommute/work remote if they want to and not pressurize them to come into the office.",5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0
Tue Oct 29 2019 10:49:31 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Great place to work... if you aren't in Sales.,I have been working at Salesforce full-time for more than 3 years,14,"Salesforce runs a sales organization like no other. Even if you have been a seller for 30 years, one full year at Salesforce will elevate your game. You will leave here a far better seller than when you arrived. Their operational expertise, sales execution, deal inspection, etc., are better than anyone in the business (for now). 

I've worked with some of the smartest people I ever have in Enterprise software. Imagine the top 10% of the sellers at your current company. Now imagine that the entire Salesforce sales organization consists entirely of that top 10%. Yeah, that describes the intensity.","The executive leadership team at Salesforce exemplifies the values they espouse and they truly believe that the world can be changed by business. Unfortunately, the values that are core to our belief system (doing what's right for the customer, trust, etc.) do not filter down to the actual sales process. There's a tendency to encourage customers to do things unnatural to their buying process, all in the interest of making the month. 

You will subjected to immense pressure here. The company, to their credit, has tried to emphasize wellness with meditation rooms in each office, etc. But much like volunteer time off, I know very few sales people that have time to enjoy those perks outside of offsites.

With only 50% of AEs exceeding plan, your success depends entirely on timing and territory. AEs who have not missed their number in years come to Salesforce only to fail because the alchemy involved in assigning quotas. There's a reason why so many AEs turn over after less than 2 years. 

It's unfortunate as the company really wants to do well in the world. The","Re-evaluate the sales team's metrics for success and what will ultimately make the company successful long term. As a leader, I'm evaluated on one thing - ACV. Financially, there's no incentive to develop my sales reps, make them better, help them find new roles within the company, help them evolve into the next generation of leaders, etc. 

Your incentive plan dictates the actions you want leaders to take. If ACV is a manager's only focus, what do you think the manager will focus on to the exclusion of all else? Incorporate metrics around employee satisfaction, retention, development, etc. The message you have been sending is that salesforce does not want leaders, only sales managers. 

More importantly, based on the metrics that are important to the company (i.e. growth and ACV), the managers who excel are the ones that drive their teams into the ground. Yes, it's an enterprise software company and yes, ACV matters, but the question leadership needs to ask itself is ""at what expense?"" 

In my little over 3 years here, it's apparent there's been a shift in the culture. Whether that's the ""Oracle"" undercurrent that's been forming over the past few years or simply challenges in the business, Salesforce has definitely lost it's glimmer as a destination career.

Salesforce on your resume does mean a lot.","OTE is ballooned - Majority of people don't hit their OTE. By far.

Management is extreme micro-managers. Expect pipe reviews 3x a week. Your 1-1 times with your managers tend to be more of a pipe review session than a career advancement meeting.

After someone leaves (Which is extremely high turnover). Management usually blames that person for everything (Including why the team is doing poorly.

Your quota's are not in alignment with company growth strategy. 
i.e. - generally a company will align compensation closely with what the business is trying to achieve. If a company wants 30% growth, they tie quota to 40-50% growth for instance. Our whole division did an audit on our patches, and in order to hit your quota, you were responsible for ~210-300% GROWTH in your patch. A divisions goal for the year was only 20-30% growth YoY.

- They took the alcohol away because they hire alcoholics
- Everything is a snowflake and not scalable (they will eventually figure this out and it will hurt when it matters)

- Too much management so nothing actually gets done
- CAB/change management is incompetent
- Dev does not seem to know how to make their products stable or supportable
- Infrastructure does not seem to know how to make their environments stable

- Internal Salesforce recruiting/hiring is worthless
- Indy Tower move provides no benefit to employees and worsens work life balance
- Commute worse now since the move to the ivory tower
- Pay for your own parking (penalized for not living in the city)
- No real room for growth within Marketing Cloud for SREs
- Worst career decision I have made from a skill set perspective (no marketable skill set growth outside of the company)
- Company liberal agenda constantly shoved down your throat
- Employees placed into a silo
- Mandatory holiday work for Marketing Cloud so other companies can send more spam to people who do not want it
- SRE team mandatory weekly on call rotation recently went from 4 weeks/year to 15 weeks/year (yes, seriously, and that is the main reason I quit Salesforce for a real #dreamjob elsewhere)
- The company itself provides no real benefit to society so they allow employees to volunteer to feel fulfilled on the inside but really it is thinly veiled attempt at marketing and promotion of the company
- Stressful workplace
- Job titles are made up
- Open office concept is detrimental to productivity and health in general
- Cult feeling with all the internal lingo
- Ridiculous amount of money spent on unnecessary things but then they take away the small amount of money they contributed to parking costs which is a necessity
- Giant corporation now... culture cannot keep up with acquisitions. News flash: people are different in different parts of the country and the rest of the world. Company needs to just admit they are the same as other giant corporations.
- No longer feels like a innovative/entrepreneurial/start-up company (Now we just buy those kinds of companies, even if it doesn't make sense. I'm looking at you Quip.)
- The company has never told a customer no, even when they needed to do so and the company is feeling it
- Company seems to reward bad client behavior instead of correcting it
- I am tired of typing but there are definitely more cons than pros","Live the values you preach. Stop making your employee's lives worse instead of better. Indy is a small tech community and once word gets out, which has already begun, you will experience a much harder time than you already do recruiting talent and more importantly, retaining talent. There are numerous local, successful startups sucking top talent out of the Marketing Cloud. The best employees and thought leaders are leaving in droves. I do not expect this to stop anytime soon. The brain drain continues and talented employees are being replaced with less talented, cheaper labor, like Bob.

Additionally, the client support experience is a nightmare now that you began replacing skilled engineers with unskilled, low cost overseas workers who can barely speak/write/comprehend English.

The people are great and their is a real team environment. People really want to help and do the best for the team and the customer. I've never seen another company close to this. Salesforce also follows a model that donates 1% of revenue, 1% of time and 1% of product to charity. As an employee, I get 5 days of Volunteer Time Off and charitable donation matches. It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time. Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia. Salesforce is also trying to be sustainable and is a carbon-neutral cloud. . No other company can say that. Compensation aside this company is a 7 on a scale of 1-5.","That said the compensation is a quagmire of BS. First you can already expect an OTE significantly less than what is the norm in the industry. Worse still is the 40 acts of vaudeville to figure out if you will get paid, if you get paid and what amount they base it on. We are out there saying use Salesforce as your system of record and every month my Xactly has little similarity to my sales in Salesforce. Come on, guys. Let's not be hypocrites! Then when you think it can get no worse there is a virtual rubics cube of ways you lose ACV or see $ clawed back. You have to be an accountant to figure out if you can sell to an account and retire quota. It's ridiculous how many times, in a short time I have not gotten the full value of my sale due to some arbitrary attrition I was not even aware of as a co-prime. Do you want me to sell or do you want me to audit the accounts to see if I can retire quota with a sale?",Get Xactly to match Salesforce dashboards and stop the clawback BS.

Snacks
Nice view from the upper floors","Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. 
- 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened.
-Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review.
- No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. 
- If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. 
- If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. 
-Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. 
-No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. 
-If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" 
- Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. 
- When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. 
-If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion.","Hate to break it to you, but you aren't all that. Your technology stack is antiquated, think Oracle lite. You are an employer, you are not and never should be anyone's family. Your employee turn over rates continue to go up, this is not a good sign. The people that remain cannot go anywhere, golden handcuffs, lack of real technical knowledge. As a company you are slow to move, lack agility, and if anyone ever decides to seriously compete, you are in trouble. Oh, and Benioff is a good businessman, he is not the 2nd coming. The slavish devotion is off putting to anyone with a healthy world view. EVERYONE should be questioned, that is how you learn and grow. Putting him and his views off limits, is not a long term strategy for success.",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

High pay, though they don't have as frequent stock refreshes as other large tech companies.","Sort of bizarre workplace environment & culture. I didn't see much in the way of manager training or ensuring that the right ICs were promoted to people manager roles. Annual reviews are in no-way transparent. You are assessed on a set of criteria that is not shared with you (either the criteria or the assessment results). My review was five minutes: ""You're doing great!"" There was no actionable feedback, stretch goals or written documentation for me to learn and grow from.  Leadership in my org very often resorted to bullying and openly shared negative feedback on their own peers with their reports. Several times while working there, I lost my engineering title due to re-orgs and was told that they ""didn't want to transfer headcount,"" so was left with only limited technical work to do for long stretches. And that's my biggest complaint - at least in my org, hard and innovative work was not championed but rather avoided in pursuit of very easy and short-term goals.","If people are hired into engineering roles, do not take those titles and work away.

- Career Path is astounding, the ability to explore/try new roles as the company grows is a solid differentiator."," Pace: simply put, the frenetic company growth is unsustainable. At its peak, think of back-to-back 80 hour weeks, juggling 6 tasks at once, back-to-back meetings & calls to get the job done properly. Annual quotas that continue to go up isn't something that go on forever, right?
- Management: The company is growing so fast, first-line managers are going to be the weakness that cripples this company. Not saying there aren't good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones. To fill the void, Salesforce hires externally (i.e. Oracle) who brings their less-than-desirable practice into Salesforce. Lack of homegrown leadership is the company's biggest weakness, by far

Long term vision balanced with execution focus to meet and exceed Wall Street expectations. M&A reflects humility that other companies have certain capabilities that are better to buy than try to catch up to internally.,"F&S leadership is floundering - they delay communicating bad news and let the rumor mill run amok, while they post cursory cheerleader-positive messages all the time on Chatter about work anniversaries. The finance team's technology is a decade behind and it will be at least another two years before they catch up - in the meantime, leadership are holding F&S headcount basically flat so workloads are piling up. If their processes were airtight it would be manageable, but this is a 40,000+ person company that still creates headcount plans in google docs and can’t decide what “materiality” means. Every process here has at least three exceptions, none of which are officially documented. 

Coupled with a very hot job market, this means that F&S employees have left at a high clip in 2019, at all levels of the organization. The CFO has decided that hiring in Finance should default to being in Indianapolis, a fact that was not well-communicated, and nor was the end state; does this mean the entire leadership team will sit in San Francisco while the analysts and managers will be 2,000 miles away?

Too many people have spent their entire careers here - they think their culture and way of doing things are inherently superior because the company has been so successful - I argue the company has been successful in spite of those things rather than because of them. 

The “Ohana” obsession feels cultish, and the idea that everyone has to be nice to each other is great, except certain teams are very noticeably exempt from that expectation while others are expected to toe the line. Either this applies to everyone or it’s window dressing and PR.","Drop the dual-CEO structure; it slows down decision making and creates ambiguity in acute situations. A company at this scale needs Keith as the sole CEO and for Marc to take a step back as an adviser. 

To the CFO: actually live the “trust” value by being upfront with your people. When we hear from you it feels like you only address the positive stuff.

This wasn't obvious to me because the compensation was considerably higher than at my previous company. I wished I had asked more questions and had asked for a higher title.

Sat Feb 23 2019 15:35:09 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Vice President Sales,"Jacksonville, FL",Current Employee ,A wonderful company that is starting to not be so wonderful,I have been working at Salesforce full-time for more than 5 years,114,"Salesforce is a destination company and there are few places where you will find so many truly interesting and gifted people in one firm. There is a real effort to continue to promote the company's values, including trust and equality. Support for philanthropy is significant (although I would agree with the reviewer who noted that ""volunteer"" activities are often anything but voluntary but rather expected/required. (Not to say that giving back is anything other than positive, but it's just worth noting that most company activities include it as part of the agenda.)

The customers are interesting and the tech is pretty solid. The benefits are what you would expect from a firm that wants to hire top talent, in other words, extensive and high quality.

The company continues to grow at quite a fast rate, and that is an imperative. The acquisitions are part of that and it's quite clear that they are necessary since there is only so much organic growth coming out of the core businesses. If you are in a ""good"" territory / team / department, this may in fact be a dreamjob. There are quite a lots of employees who are able to devote many hours (days) to volunteer causes, company social functions, training opportunities and so on. This is particularly the case if you are employed in one of the hub offices.","The rapid growth and the pressure around quarterly metrics is starting to come at the expense of cohesion and quality. The annual reorganization of the business is quite disruptive and is particularly problematic in business areas where the sales cycles are longer, like the more heavily regulated verticals or larger enterprise environments where aligning stakeholders and building vision takes time. You can work your &#$# off here and have all that worked handed off to someone else in a new fiscal. Happens a lot.

Above the mid management/senior director level, the political environment resembles the Hunger Games. The lack of capable management and the lack of transparency around career progression / promotion are a drag on the business and a significant business risk. The departures of more tenured people should be very concerning to leadership; just look at the difference in the reviews of new (<1 year) employees and those with 5 or more years of experience. It's not a positive marker. There is a reason that the employee survey now asks about the ""psychological safety"" of our workplace. Leadership should be commended for recognizing that this is a problem, but now needs to actually do something to fix it. Just adding a feedback app and calendar reminders to use it are probably not going to get the job done.

Once you are hired, progression within the company can be difficult. There is a policy that all internal transfers should be lateral in terms of grade and compensation, even if an external candidate with the same credentials would be offered significantly more compensation and a bigger title. There is a sense that the only way to get a promotion is often to threaten to (or actually) resign and unfortunately, plenty of evidence that this is an effective strategy.","The company's attention to culture, values and social justice are admirable. Recognize that those efforts also create an expectation within the firm that ALL management will demonstrate those values - something that is far from reality. This is not a problem that is going to be solved with Trailhead. Cultivating good people managers who can support and develop talent within the company should be as much of a priority as sales, and great management talent should be celebrated and rewarded. Likewise, those who treat people poorly, have significant attrition or staff departing for other teams should not be retained in management positions.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0

- Employee success is really good.
- There are some genuinely talented people who can help you learn.
- If you get on a good team (which is a stroke of luck), you might have some good projects to work on.
- Good brand name & external perception.
- Depending on team and your abilities to talk in badly run meetings, you may end up experiencing a huge growth."," A very unsafe culture. Predatory behavior in meetings. Only a white can do such a thing and not face any consequences because trust is a right for the whites and for colored it is a loosely hanging privilege which might be lost anytime and needs to constantly work on earning the privilege. I saw people even at Sr.Director level (who was colored) just leaving the meeting not knowing what to say or do. Eventually that Sr.Director (who was top notch) left the team in the name of personal reasons. Believe it or not, those whites even got promotions and MVP awards.

- Nepotism is prevalent. I was fully surprised by the way an engineering lead was lifted up to a top level leadership level so quickly (< 3 months since joining) without producing any good results. He was referred by another well positioned person in the team. The guy lacked humanity and was untrustworthy. He was aggressive, inconsistent, unresponsive, over-confident and was stepping on others toes a lot. Even providing feedback in the feedback app with facts to stop doing such things didn't help.

- Absolutely no transparency in promotions. People who did great things didn't get promoted and they left. I was a founding engineer who worked for closely 2 years. Many of the peer reviews were extremely positive. I was involved in some of the top level architecture meetings, was openly stated in those meetings that this is a really critical piece so i was needed to do it and ultimately got the job done from me, only to let a white take over the project once it was done and I saw others getting promoted who built on top of the work I had done. My manager didn't say any bad things in our 1:1s, he promoted others, resigned and just before leaving he talked to me for a minute over a phone call and we never met. I was the biggest fool to trust these people.

- I was low balled on the pay and the recruiter lied to me that salesforce doesn't do any sign on bonus and negotiations.

- Extremely operations heavy culture. Once a product is built and released to the customers, the pace at which things move is unbelievably slow. Leadership kills innovations, condescends on engineers who innovated and worked hard to build the product and makes everything operations centric."," Passive aggression is building up. 
- Bias, nepotism, sugar coating is all over the place. 
- Doing the right thing is not valued.
- In the name of team play, there is absolutely no boundaries, accountability and reliability. People with good political skills thrive in this environment by making others do their job (it's a team play and everyone should say yes to everything, right?).

Find a way to solve the above problems. I know it is hard because there is no visibility of the front liners work to the management and you are choosing to trust some people to lead and manage. Most importantly find a way to stop predatory behavior of whites in meetings to make sure people are respected and treated well so they can feel safe to come to meetings and office everyday.",3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 

8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). 

If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. 

Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. 

SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV)

Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. 

BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!)

As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense.","SDRs, BDRs, and AEs need more collaboration. Management should be more aligned to help this collaboration. 

BDRs should be measured very differently then they are now. What is currently in place is not a successful business model. The people that actually stay in the BDR role are typically the ones that end up being weak salespeople - AKA not ""hungry closers."" You are losing really great sales talent because of this.

Put more emphasis on BDRs having better customer service skills and really driving the sales process longer - rather than just throwing meetings at AEs who don't always have time to follow up. It is confusing for the customer to have so many different POCs. This would help the AEs save time, help BDRs learn and develop, make customers more inclined to buy, and be better for overall talent retention.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0

Many of the sales reps are unhappy with many things but stay because of how well the company performs/innovates. Base salaries are extremely low. There are very few people that are hitting their annual numbers and the overall compensation plus base is just not there. So much of it is based on territory but leaders will say to their graves that all territories are even. We would have much more appreciated it being called out vs. lying to our faces that they are all spread equally. 

Overall there is a lot of negativity here and much of this stems from the unhappy customers. Salesforce customers, especially in the SMB space don’t have the money to spend to implement Salesforce so their orgs are bad and adoption is extremely low. Account executives are responsible for selling - but also dealing with all unhappy customers, cancellations, technical support questions, etc. It doesn’t help that the renewals and billing teams are both outsourced to foreign counties and are extremely hard to work with (both internally and externally).

Decent benefits, great offices, fast growing (esp. valuable if you have stock), viewed as elite on resume, general salary levels, decent technology portfolio, vibrant culture, focus on volunteering / giving back to communities","As Salesforce has grown from 10K to 40K employees over this past decade, the politics, bureaucracy, and all forms of bias from race to gender to not being part of the ""SF/Bay area type"" or ""Salesforce OG type"" employee has permeated detrimentally to everything from compensation (salary and RSUs) to promotions to general respect in the business.
What makes this worse is the outward perception of equality Salesforce is generally known for, is not a reality for most of these underserved groups. There was a recently an ask from the top to stop being so political and ""back-stabbing"" in nature to senior leadership. The irony being those in that room in the vast majority were successful at Salesforce by being just that way. They have no business being responsible for fixing the culture they created and benefitted and continue to benefit from every day.","For once actually hold people accountable for their actions in being discriminatory. Stop retaliating against those who bring up the clear cases of bias esp. when they are putting themselves at great personal and career risk in doing so.
Stop proclaiming to the world that we are leaders in equality when our top-level leadership is dominated by white men and generally in top four layers of the organization by white people generally.

I care for all of my team members well being, and support them personally and professionally as much as possible. So do my colleagues.","Underneath the facade, Salesforce is focused on perception more than reality. VTO isn't volunteer time off at all. It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry. We once had a travel freeze but the company still sent the top 100+ employees to a big shindig in Hawaii - and they broadcast it and insisted that everyone across the company ""tune in"" to it remotely.

The ability to volunteer using VTO, but agree with others. In some teams it is not volunteer work, you are required to put it in your V2MOM and complete it on some teams. The ability to do interesting work, connect with other talented individuals, and the training/learning opportunities.","On a recent survey, two of the lowest scoring questions revolve around people politicking and backstabbing to get things done and the lowest score company wide was promotions are handled in a fair and transparent way. The promotion question has been a bottom 5 scoring question for 2 years now. I have witnessed people promoted either for unfair reasons or because threatening to leave. They pass off a promotion as someone being promoted when in all actuality they applied to an internal job posting and were hired, that’s not really a promotion. The answer to fixing this is not more documentation on careers.
They put on a front that they value trust and transparency. They want you to be able to have difficult conversations with your manager without fear of retaliation, but I have witnessed people who speak up and are retaliated against with maybe a Performance Improvement Plan or a demotion. I sometimes feel as if managers and leaders here are talking the talk but not walking the walk when it comes to truly living by the Ohana values.
There is a feeling on some teams that it is easier and less stressful not using your PTO vs using it. Tough finding and training multiple backups to handle their job and yours while out.
Recently a decline in billable work that has them reassigning people to new careers. It is tough seeing work sent to vendors in India when people at Salesforce are struggling to get billable work.
Bonus for some 100% based on billable work which you have no control over. Person A could have 4 accounts and 40+ billable hours, resulting in a very healthy bonus; while Person B might have 1 account and is receiving 10 hours of work, receiving a much smaller bonus. The division of labor is not fair and should be distributed more evenly.
Seems a bit unfair when Salesforce gives an executive a $200,000 car and $86,000 watch as a bonus for exceptional work, when you have witnessed others do exceptional work on a smaller scale (not necessarily bringing in $8 million in Sales) and all they get is a Chatter shoutout from their manager or their name mentioned on a PowerPoint slide.
I agree with another review here...it is tough dealing with a travel ban, not being able to travel to visit coworkers during a Christmas party, but the top people were all in Hawaii that year. I remember that.","There is a problem here with people being afraid to speak up. I feel a majority want to remain anonymous because they are afraid of retaliation if they speak up. People need to see evidence of others who spoke up and the company actually did the right thing afterwards.
Better training or ways to evaluate leaders and management. These are the people that play a huge part in job satisfaction, career growth, psychological health, and being an advocate for their subordinates. If a promotion was unfair and not transparent, it is the manager and the people approving those promotions that should be looked at.",2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0

This often results in aggressive behavior where each discipline intimidates the other to do what they want or pass blame when something goes wrong. The exec leaders of these orgs verbally battle it out with each other in very public reviews that are streamed across their entire orgs and this sets the example that trickles down throughout the teams.",Offer a way for any employee to point out behavior that does not support the Ohana in a method that feels safe and have the option to get support over the interaction. Hire behavioral coaches that observe interactions in reviews and coach our leadership how to conduct debates and discussions without aggression.,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

Wed Apr 10 2019 07:25:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Senior Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,"Huge, quickly growing company where it's hard to do good work",I worked at Salesforce full-time for more than a year,5,"Salesforce is a hugely successful company hiring 19K people from 2018-2020. Visionary CEO Marc Benioff, created an idealistic culture where employees are paid to volunteer 50 hours a year, and the company matches their charitable donations up to $10K a year. At the company's San Francisco headquarters, employees have daily access to the best view on the West Coast, the 61st floor of Salesforce Tower. The workforce is generally smart, professional, and ethical. There are plenty of resources. Managers are on the whole receptive to new projects.","Because Salesforce is growing so fast – doubling its workforce and revenue over two years – many things get lost in the shuffle. Some teams have crushing workloads, while others are virtually forgotten. The prevailing infrastructure of the company is a parochial network of vice presidents operating independently. This leads to disconnection, and occasionally chaos. Teams duplicate work, work in contradictory directions, and compete pointlessly. Territoriality for budget and resources is rampant. There are no centralized checks and balances. If you have a bad or unethical warlord, you may be asked to do things that are counterproductive or even hurtful. The patchwork of fiefdoms across the company is so disconnected that many teams are unaware of similar teams within the company. Efforts to organize or connect strategies are met with resistance and sometimes hostility. A chief strategy officer with a team of connected project managers could address this, but many VPs don't want accountability. The result is work that doesn't rise above mediocrity. Salesforce is a great company comprised of dozens of mediocre companies. Those mediocre companies don't want to connect and be great because their leaders don't want to lose status. Once you see that you can't unsee it. Many workers grow cynical as a result. The famed ""Ohana"" (Hawaiian for family) doesn't penetrate the 300-yard stare of hardened coworkers who don't say hello in elevators.","It is incumbent upon the C-level executives to coordinate their teams and break down silos. The weakest layer of the company is the VP strata. Those leaders need pressure to work together, share resources, and adhere to centralized strategies.",3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0
