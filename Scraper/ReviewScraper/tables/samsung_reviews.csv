Supervisors are well underpaid (salary range $49k-$70k+) when considering the amount of time spent in the plant as well as the workload. There is a major disconnect between HR and supervisors on the production floor. We are treated like incompetent children by HR. They do not take the time to establish a professional relationship with us. The communication between HR and management here is extremely poor. There is no chain of command in the way information is delivered. Quite often the associates will receive pertinent information before the supervisor. This place is also not a safe place to work at. Safety is not a top concern to upper management. The turnover rate is alarming high. We lost at least 20 salary employees within the month of July alone.
