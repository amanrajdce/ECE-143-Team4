- Flexible working hours
- Travel perks
- Access to communicate with anyone in the company
- As of recent, a lot of training resources for new hires
- The company is HUGE and global, so there are opportunities to transfer almost anywhere
- Expedia Group is a powerhouse in online travel so business growth will likely maintain even in unfavorable economic periods--therefore job security is not a major concern"," Extremely top-heavy
- Lack of diversity in management
- Limited career growth opportunities
- Labels itself as a platform tech company, does not pay as such
- If you rub elbows with the right executives & directors, you will soar in this company; however hard work and consistent success will not necessarily get you to where you want to be","Overall, Expedia Group has the means of being one of the best places to work. Period. Having global access to resources and teams, stellar benefits, and a general progressive disposition (flexible scheduling, modern offices, open lines of communication) are all amazing building blocks to creating the ideal work environment. However, the company needs to continue building on these things to truly move in the right direction in being an ""exceptional place where people come to do their best work"". Below are a few of the things I believe are hindering the company's progression:

- Stop focusing on how to place your white male buddies additional Executive Director and Senior Director positions and focus on promoting the growth and success of the associates that truly drive the business
- We see that you're trying to ""promote"" diversity & inclusion in the company, but saying and doing are two different things
- Really take the Rate Your Stay results about growth, development, and compensation to heart as opposed to acknowledging it is a problem and putting a band-aid over it
- You've done a great job in creating open lines of communication, however it means nothing if little to no action comes of what your associates are highlighting as pain points and concerns",3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0

- Very flexible WFH policies
- Very nice, friendly people 
- Easy to move up if you're willing to relocate
- Good job if you like talking to people on the phone a lot"," Incredibly boring job that doesn't make you feel any level of fulfillment. You'll spend 9-5 calling hotels and begging them for the best rates and room availability. There's not much strategy outside of that.
- Lots of recent changes that have made the role even more robotic than it was before. Leadership has removed team leadership positions that previously would allow market associates to gain more experience in other areas such as finance or marketing. Now, they only want you to focus on contacting as many hotels as possible. Quantity > quality.
- Very difficult to move up if you're unwilling to relocate. If you don't want to relocate, it's practically seniority-based so you better hope a few people above you leave! (pretty common since there is high turnover in market management)
- Not challenging at all, and you won't develop really any technical skills. On most days I'd think ""I can't believe I went to college to be doing THIS.""
- The technology is very poor, so often times it's difficult to do your day-to-day job","This role is essentially a glorified sales call center, and I don't think that is made very clear in the job description. Leadership needs to give employees throughout the organization more opportunities for growth and development, since people can't simply act like robots all day.

Mon Sep 16 2019 22:55:18 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Engagement Specialist,"Bellevue, WA",Former Employee ,Great company to work for... if you're in the right department.,I worked at Expedia Group full-time for more than 3 years,2,"I was able to work at Expedia for 3 years. I started out as a contractor in one department then was able to make my way into a permanent position in another department. I will list out below about the positives of working here.

-Work/Life balance is fantastic for a corporation. I feel like the Expedia as a whole cares about their employees and wants to make sure they can actually have a life outside of work. Over-time, at least in my positions, was never a thing. If you couldn't finish your work, you just come back to it the next day without sweating it. 

-Benefits are solid. Starting out of the gate, you get 15 days of PTO plus 2 floating holidays. You also have 401k, health insurance options, health and wellness reimbursements up to $600 bucks and a bit of travel reimbursements. They are also willing to match up to 6% of what you invest for 401k. If you happen to work at HQ, they also provide an onsite health clinic and gym for employees. 

-Flexible schedules - I started my day at 6am every day just to be able to beat out traffic and was out of the office generally at 2-2:30pm.

-They work hard on making sure everyone feels welcome and included no matter race or culture. They put an effort into having company events for a wide variety of different holidays. 

-Managers that you can relate with. I had excellent managers that actually care about how you are doing and want to know what is going on in your personal life to better accommodate you in the office.

-They do want to retain people when they can. If you do your job well as a contractor, there is a good chance that they are looking to make you into a permanent employee, unlike companies like Amazon that will work people hard for 3-6 months then toss them out like office trash.","Depending on what department you get into, it can affect how you work and how you might feel about your job.

-Some departments love using time trackers such as the Omni tool to keep tabs of what their employees are doing during the day. Upper management will say that they don't micromanage until they force your direct manager to sit down and talk about your numbers to find out how you can be 'more efficient' even if you already have good numbers.

-Upper management will sometimes blatantly ignore what is being said among their employees. If big changes are made to the department, they rather stay the course even if it's burning out their workforce, just to say that something is working even though it isn't.

-There isn't much room for advancement. Managers/leads tend to stay in the company for a long time, so those who are below them will hit a point where they can't advance and compensation ends up not being enough. 

-If you don't use all your PTO in the year, it's gone. There is no rollover for PTO but there is for sick time. Managers do make sure to mention this to their employees pretty often throughout the year but there should be some rollover. 

-The HR department is an absolute wreck. First off, you would think a corporation of this size should have a physical department on-site at HQ. Every one of them is remote, which makes it extremely difficult to get anything done in a timely manner. When you have something pressing to talk to HR about, you can expect it to be anywhere from 2-5 days of waiting. Yep, DAYS!!! It's infuriating when you are trying to be time conscious and they don't seem to give a damn.

-If you are applying for a job, don't expect to hear back from them anytime soon. Expect on average about 50+ days to hear back from them, even if it is just to send a rejection.","The main thing is to listen more to your employees. The company promotes this but it seemed to start slipping more towards the end of my time there.

Also, please fix HR, make a physical location for employees. If it's taking as long as I said it was to get a response, which it does, either have more training for those already there to field calls or hirer more people. Maybe have them on the time trackers instead of others that are making good use of their time.",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

They provide good benefits and a nice downtown office. I absolutely loved this company and this job before a particular person came into their management position. I was passionate about the business and excited for what was next.","I had my work/life balance privileges ""suspended"" for 2 months (eligible after 6 months, I received at 8 months with the company). She allowed other employees on our team who had been working here for less than 6 months to work from home and leave early for things such as hair appointments, while denying every request I made in this regard. These instances were a huge deterrent to me, and my confidence level plummeted, as I was being treated obviously differently than my peers.

I had many meetings with my manager about the management and feedback style that works best for me, as well as what I respond best to as an employee. She continued to disregard my requests and only notify me of mistakes and shortcomings, never an encouragement nor a thank you. The continuous negativity towards me took a real toll on my morale as an employee.
 
My manager's way of ""coaching"" me was to reiterate that me working for Expedia was like “trying to fit a round peg in a square hole” and that it would be “very mature” of me to decide that this job isn’t for me. In my opinion, because of someone who’s role is to grow and develop a team of people, I felt extremely discouraged and almost pushed out. I felt marginalized, disrespected, and discouraged by my manager almost every single day, and this took a sincere toll on my confidence and self-respect.","I had always been told at Expedia to fail fast and fail forward. However, certain members of the Denver leadership team do not seem to follow this principle that Expedia preaches, and tend to continually punish anyone who makes any mistakes. If 4 people have been ""fired"" and/or left the company in the past year, perhaps management should start looking at the leader of this team as the issue, as opposed to the employees themselves... 

I was also a bit disappointed in HR during my last few weeks with the company. I was told by an HR rep that she would send over some talking points for me when discussing leaving with my team, as well as an email template for a farewell email note. I never received any of these documents, even after reaching back out and asking twice for them. I also requested an exit interview, which the HR rep missed and asked to reschedule for Monday – However, it was my last day...",2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

Career advancement is non existent. No more special projects to work on. Recognition and awards are no longer handed out.

There have been some recent promotions within the department, that those that were promoted were told they could keep their favorable schedules instead of giving those schedules to the seasoned analysts who have been there longer.

Expedia is stable and the risk of company failure is very, very low. Layoffs are also not likely outside of very specific instances involving handfulls of people.
Management avoids terminating FTEs, to the point of keeping low performers.
There are many benefits not found at many other companies.
Management and senior ICs get to travel internationally a lot.","Expedia is not a Technology company. It says it wants to be, but it is a Travel company first, controlled by the Product organization.
Conversion, and related KPI's, are more important than anything else.
Expedia's technical management, from fist line managers to VPs, are often not technical and have no programming experience. No one at that level talks about ""Big O"", Algorithms, Data Structures or other CS concepts.
Monolithic thinking permeates architect and management thinking.
Most ideas and all decisions are top-down. People are told what to do. Problems are solved at the executive level and dictated into the organizations.
Expedia Group is really many separate businesses, each with a separate and different culture, tech stack, standards and processes. Silos, and the walls they create, are everywhere.
Social Justice programs are promoted by everyone in management, and speaking out against them is just not done by anyone. There is no debate or discussion.
Strong technical leaders are not embraced by the leadership community, and leave. Most strong developers leave for more challenging and fast paced companies. If you want to learn from great technologists, Expedia is not the place.","Keep an office in Bellevue after the move to Seattle.
Set a technical bar for technical leaders (EM to VP), hold people to it, and remove those that don't meet it.
Tenure should not be a criteria in promotions. Tenure should not influence a yearly performance review/rating/raise/bonus. Those with no experience outside Expedia are at risk of not having the experience necessary to accomplish the ""Transformation"" Expedia is attempting.

Starting pay is very competitive. 
The culture is fantastic and very open. 
The employee part of benefits is fairly low. 
Most employees can work remotely occasionally, and they understand family needs.","If you excel at your position, do more than is asked, and even accept the responsibilities of a higher level position, you stand less of a chance to get promoted than an outside person has of getting the job. The fact that you understand the company and how to get things done within it won't be taken into consideration, even though an outside hire will take over a year to get up to speed. 

After your initial hire the pay increases will barely keep up with the increases for your part of the benefits (which really isn't much). Don't expect to make a large jump in pay, even if you somehow manage to get promoted.",Cultivating leadership from within will gain you more loyalty and better employees than only looking to the outside for it.
