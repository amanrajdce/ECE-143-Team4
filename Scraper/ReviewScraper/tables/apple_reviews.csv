The company is AMAZING. There are limitless advancement opportunities. You work with some very cool people and the leadership cares about your development. You may get coaching but you never get battered or belittled. The pay is decent and the benefits include, 401(k) match, stock purchase options, product discounts and discounts on services across many different areas, education assistance, child care assistance, paid vacation, sick time and other time off options, health club Reimbursment or bike cost set off. You get 1.5 time for OT and it's pretty much unlimited as long as you don't exceed 12 hours in a day or 59 total in a week.",The schedule changes every 90 days and you have to bid for your shifts so you never know what you are going to get. This makes it extremely hard to plan your life to far in advance. You are also pretty much assured to work a Saturday or Sunday.,,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

Great benefits. Employee discounts are pretty good.","Well, the retail division has become a weird place to work at. A lot of managers are afraid to be truthful about the nature of the job, which is ultimately sales and technical support with a little bit of training so they dance around tough situations and sometimes aren't honest with the team. There is a lot of politics involved with promotions. Favoritism is definitely a factor. In some cases it doesn't matter how experienced you are or how knowledgable you are, if you want to get promoted you've got to play the game. Feedback is something that in most cases isn't used properly. Apple hires very smart people at retail division, then once they are in, the managers don't really know (or sometimes care) how to develop them. Oh, and don't even think about giving honest feedback to leadership team. Most of them are so drunk from the Kool Aid that instead of listening to you and maybe making changes they they will dismiss your feedback or in some cases make life very difficult so you leave the company on your own.",,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0

They pride themselves on culture but I never saw it, and managers were never friendly or empathic with me on my personal needs or my medical needs. I told them before my firing that this would really be rock bottom for me and that is kill myself. When they fired me in a webcam session I honestly considered it, and with 2 managers on camera pulled my gun out cocked it and put it to my head on camera. They didn't respond or do anything before I told them I need to leave and shut down my computer. I dare anyone at Apple to pull that session since I know it's recorded, but that's who you're dealing with You'll be screwed time and again on your schedule so just get used to that. 4 years I was there, never once did I get the schedule I wanted or anything close to it. And you'll be severally chastised for asking questions about it, the last time I did I was mysteriously fired 2 days later. The times for that by the way are 1pm-2am EST. So if you can't work those hours don't bother applying because these people simply don't care. No matter what you are the customers punching bag, no it's ands or buts. This company will never have your back.
