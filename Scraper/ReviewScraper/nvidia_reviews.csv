Great appreciation for innovation, research and improvements.
Steady growth in terms of career, and a lot of possibilities for personal development - like internal lectures/conferences, partner programs with universities, web learning portals, domain experts, etc.
Bleeding edge technology and experts in multiple fields, ties to the scientific R&D - and you can take part in any of those fields and acquire knowledge from experts.
Competitive salaries.
Management is mostly built of people with serious practical background, so they have a lot of understanding what is going on, and a vision that is both very practical, AND innovative.
Feeling that you build and shape future.","Mentioned flexibility doesn't work well for all of the people - some people feel comfortable with more strict, managed environment, strictly formulated tasks and timeframes, and don't appreciate too much of the individual freedom.
Resources of the company are more limited to those of a bigger companies which sometimes may be perceived as a good thing sometimes (work smarter, not harder), but otherwise it limits the potential possibilities.","IT infrastructure needs to be even better (it is being improved, but at rates that are slower that is desirable).",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

ESPP in particular is great generally, and has been amazing over the past 10-ish years.
- Fellow engineers tend to be dedicated and skilled.
- Being in a fabless semiconductor company provides unique challenges compared to say, transmitting advertisements 1% faster."," A switch to ""Agile"" development was done by people who have no idea what Agile is
- Depending on your team, if you don't put 6 hours in per day in JIRA, you will get a nag email. Helping other teams? No way! Going to meetings? Well, not too many...
- Corners are cut frequently. You will never feel proud of your work, always surprised it shipped.
- Does some task require special expertise? Well here is a 1 hour meeting about it a week after the task needs to be done. Maybe just read the slides, no time to actually attend that meeting. Want to read a book to understand the topic better? No way, there is no JIRA task for that.
- Employees complained about lack of Learning and Development resources so, they paid for Coursera. Not enough for all employees, so you may have to wait. No support for learning on the job, so I guess the idea is that you'll log in on a weekend to watch videos that are often freely available.
- Very few retros/post-mortems, multiple chips will go by without your team stopping to explore why testplans are always being trimmed to be actually completed, and even then very few changes will be implemented.
-Maybe you will work 12 hours a day , 7 days a week for months. Well enjoy your expensed lunches and dinners on the weekend, that's all it's going to get you. Counts for nothing towards management, Just say No when they ask.",,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0

The engineering managers are also engineers. People work hard and are smart. Compensation is excellent. Nvidia is involved in a lot of very exciting technologies. Benefits are also good, and work hour expectations in my group are reasonable.","Some higher-ups are very opinionated, so significant decisions are often dictated by them. Certain significant people are very demanding, which can create some stress at times. It's a slightly aggressive culture, in terms of pushing for difficult challenges.","Show more appreciation.

Honesty is rewarded, covering up is not. That's unusual in the tech world.
Rank and seniority don't mean a lot. If your idea is good, it doesn't matter who you are or how long you've been here.
Lots of people here who literally wrote the book on their technological specialty.
Zero tolerance for ethnic/racial/gender/age discrimination. That's not from HR, it's everywhere. Do or say something that appeals to stereotype or prejudice and people think you're an idiot. Maybe that's how things are in 2019 techworld, but it sure is refreshing.
The commitment to reducing our environmental footprint is genuine. The stuff I've fought for at other companies along those lines is already happening here. Company strongly encourages commuting by bike, public transit, carpool or work from home.","IT is under-resourced, and gets snookered by consultants and the occasional snake oil salesman.","Spend more on IT, and outsource less.

Very high level of technical and corporate transparency across teams/sites (this is in striking contrast to many other so-called leading companies in this industry!)
Everyone believes in and works towards the company's goals and vision.
High employee morale and corporate pride.
Shared sense of success (and failures too) - not a ""me"" culture.
Employees feel valued.
Minimal politics that would block technical people from achieving their goals.
Agile decision making and course correction to stay on track with product roadmaps.
Company does not live in the past or rest too much on past success.
Fair amount of work/life balance (as long as you take responsibility).","Not suitable for people who aren't self-starters - often frustrating when onboarding to a new team to get very little help from peers which results in wasted trial/error.
A lot of tribal knowledge and sparse/outdated internal documentation/websites make it difficult and inefficient to find information.
Matrixed org structure leads to firstline managers with unmanageable amount of direct reports resulting in very low opportunity for focused one-on-one time, coaching, and development.
Too much focus on projects and staffing at Headquarters - this leads to limited growth/movement opportunities for people outside of California.
Rapid growth is stressing the company's resources and historically closeknit culture.","Thank you for being open, transparent, and most of all trusting your employees with the technical knowledge that you share globally within the company.

NVIDIA has grown up into a 14k+ employee global enterprise. It's time to realize that the old matrix/flat org structure isn't scalable anymore and doesn't support employee development. This is in large part due to managers who can no longer deliver results AND develop their people if their staff/scope is too large. 

Top level leadership should change the message to project/team managers that good talent may not necessarily exist (or want to live) in Santa Clara and they MUST be open to supporting cross-site teams. Otherwise, non-California employees will miss out on growth opportunities, get frustrated, and will be quickly recruited away by your competitors.",5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0

Their commitment to moving at the speed of light in every thing they do keeps such a large company nimble and able to respond quickly to shifts in the marketplace.",Moving at the speed of light leaves less room for process and more room for chaos. If you can handle a fluid org chart and requirements that change on sometimes a weekly basis for the bleeding edge projects then you've found the right home. If on the other hand you want stability and things that move with a little more deliberation then the hardware side of the house would be more your speed.,It's a little too easy for managers to carve out their own fiefdom and then defend it. The fluid org chart makes it seem that this wouldn't be possible but the social pressure - especially on high profile projects - keeps some walls up that really should be broken down.,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

-Strong Vision & Driven Peers - The overall vision the the company as it continues to push the boundaries of Computer Graphics, & AI is a huge factor that keeps us all motivated and thinking about what can be done next.
-Variety in Work- You won't get bored. A lot of teams work with the latest software and hardware so there is a lot of potential to try new things. This reliable change in pace keeps work interesting.","Resourcing/ Long term Planning - Every project is important and needs attention. Sometimes its hard to find the time to do everything and some teams can be stretched a little too thin. This becomes a bigger issue during launches or shows , when new tasks come in with a tight turnaround ( two-three weeks). During these times working overtime and putting in more hours becomes a must for a lot of teams. 

Pivoting - You need to be flexible and able to pivot with the company. For the most part, NVIDIA has a very steady direction but how we continue to go in that direction can change often and require teams to adapt.",Overall trust in teams and employees is great and I love working here.

The mid-level engineering managers are either still active or used to be talented technical contributors, so they are usually trustworthy in terms of making good decisions.

For such a large company now, things still seem to move pretty quickly. There is heavy emphasis on execution here, so people are conscious about minimizing the overhead.

Again, the emphasis on execution allows the company to invest quite a lot into its internal workflow and methodology.

Very open environment encourages managers and new employees alike to engaging in technical discussions.

Competitive compensation. The company seems to be focusing more towards family-friendly employee benefits, which seems to be growing in popularity.

The importance of the work is obvious to most people, without the execs having to hammer such notions obnoxiously.","The department directors seem to be throwing around catchy/buzzworthy phrases from Harvard Business Reviews, without providing mid-level managers sufficient guidance on how to address them. I felt that this lack of guidance turns such business school memes into sources of management anxiety, which eventually trickle down as stress to engineers.

Some individual contributors agree that the managers are too busy and bit ""out of touch"" with the happenings in the latest projects. The management career path does not seem very appealing, since the individual contributors constantly witness their managers having to deal with weird crap all the time.

Heavy emphasis on execution often pushes many engineers into shortsightedness. You either get criticized here for not delivering on time, or being ""too shortsighted.""

Weird product/marketing naming schemes aren't always understood by the engineers. They are typically considerate to send someone from the marketing to explain. That is very nice, but it's still not clear whether such minutia is understood by our customers.

The work culture is bit chaotic, and challenges people to adapt to new environment. Those who insist on sticking to their work process at their previous job don't fare very well.","I understand why our directors would emphasize few catchy phrases to emphasize the pertinent organizational issues at hand, but please provide the mid-level managers some guidance or examples on how to successfully cope or address them.

The work you’ll do is fulfilling, and you see how you’re contributing directly to moving the needle for the entire company. There’s plenty of room to grow and move laterally throughout the company based on your interests. Managers are fair and great mentors. There are a wealth of people to support you in your work. The culture of sharing ideas and swarming problems to solve them means that knowledge is shared quickly, and the best idea wins (not politics).","Sometimes work life balance can feel out of sync during busy times (events, launches).

Very open, collaborative environment, you can reach out literally to anybody (including CEO) and get help. CEO reads status emails (!) and engages in discussions (!) with the teams about product directions and strategies (this is in AV org, not sure about others). 
I love the idea of workstream (virtual team) that can quickly summon people across the org, I haven't seen this type of thing in other companies.
I am a senior sw developer with 22 years in the Valley and worked at a few companies here and I can compare. NVIDIA is the best without any doubt.
Benefits are mostly fine, very good health insurance choices, some perks but don't expect a lot. New building was nice, but it felt unfinished, and any improvements take long time. 
NVIDIA generally has less office politics than I've seen in other companies. (Still it exists and frustrating). The 2016-2018 stock run up was nice, I didn't make a lot of money but still I can't complain.
A lot of your personal experience may depend on the team you join. There are absolutely horrible teams to work in (avoid IPP at all cost!), but also there are greatest and brightest teams. I did an internal transfer from an-ok team to a much better team (the transfer process was smooth and everyone was supportive). To compare my RSU increased more than 2x, with better wlb, I got much much more interesting projects, and the brightest minds to work with. So, lots depends on the manager and the team.","Growth for senior engineers like myself is really really not what it should be.
 RSU grants (vest over 4 years) are calculated as % of your salary, depending on your rating you get from 0% to 50%. You get rated NI (need improvement), FC (full contributor) with 2 categories A and B, and TC (top contributor) again with A and B. 
So TC-A gets 50% of salary in RSU grants - this is the absolute top compensation bump you could achieve no matter how brilliant you are and how big an impact you make. 
I think the other scale is FC-B gets 20%, FC-A 30%, and TC-B 40%. NI gets 0%.
Let's say you're a senior making 200K/year, if you're TC-A like myself it means you get 100K in RSU over 4 years, or 25K per year. After a couple cycles (2 years) you'll realize it's really not worth it all the effort and hard work for just extra 10% of salary. Stock can grow of course, but stock can also fall.

Endeavor building was not planned well - not enough bathroom capacity for number of occupants, people end up waiting for 10-15 minutes just to use a bathroom. Really don't know what to say here.

Parking situation is horrendous - again due to bad facility planning. If you come to work at 11am or later, forget about finding parking, valet will be full, and you end up parking illegally in neighbor parking lot. Go to work and fear all day you car will get towed. 
CEO was asked this question - his answer was - don't come to work at 11. Yeah, but we still have our lives, doctor appointments, our kids and loved ones, so it does happen sometimes I have to come to work later than usual.",Improve senior people compensation - share the success of company with the people who are behind this success.,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0

With that in mind, I came in telling myself to look at this place as objectively as possible to not cloud my judgement. After working here for over a year, I must say, the hype is real.

* Super transparent and surprisingly egalitarian

 I've worked at other tech companies where it's all double-speak. Here, the hire ups are just regular dudes with added responsibilities. It's surprising how you'll be chatting with some random guy and you find out later he's a director or something. I've never experienced this before and it's awesome.

* The technology is incredible and so are the people who work on it

 I know everyone is ""Making the World a Better Place! ™"" in the valley, but seriously though, what a time to be alive! Processors that were developed for insane graphics are now used for the world's most powerful supercomputers. What's even crazier is you meet the people who develop all these tools and again... they're just regular, humble dudes doing their life's work. Outstanding.

* You're not a peasant, you are an engineer at one of the best tech companies in the world

 Coming into Nvidia, I was worried it would be a turn and burn shop like Amazon or IBM. A sort of ""We own you, now work 90 hours a week, drink this kool-aid and love us"", but it's not like that all. You're an individual and you determine your involvement/focus. This sort of freedom is incredible.

* Have I mentioned how awesome people are?

 Seriously though. I show up to work so I can work on cool things and hang out with people.","There are a few, minor ones that are just kind of annoying rather than a hindrance

* Some of the Newer Hires

 So I'm a recent hire, but I've noted some trends with the newer hires. Nvidia has made it to the big time and with that, we can start pulling in people who were originally gunning for the FANGs. The problem is, a lot of those people just care about RSU's, insane perks and literally nothing else.

* More on some of the newer hires

 They whine about the dumbest, most entitled, first-world problems. I'm not entirely sure if that Orange Mocha Frappuccino that you were served at nvcafe is entirely vegan, gluten free and fair trade certified. I'm sorry Nvidia is so awful that we don't have personal butlers at our stand by, ready to get us a kale/tofu/avocado toast that other tech companies obviously do. I'm sorry the stock dropped a little so you can't get gold rims for your jet-ski. Oh the humanity!

 I could go on, but you'll see these complaints on Glassdoor and Blind. They just care about perks and RSU's. I don't really feel like they're employees, just mercenaries ready to hop onto next thing once all their RSU's vest.","Literally just keep doing what you're doing. There's a reason why Nvidia keeps adapting and pivoting to the top. Don't evercahnge into a turn and burn shop that focuses quarter to quarter. I've been at one before and it simply doesn't work. The true way to win in the valley is to build a passionate, high-powered, talented team that can overcome anything. Don't ever change this aspect about Nvidia!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

I like to be w/ the comp because of technology and products that NVIDIA working on.","since we are remote from Austin, Tx there are so many disadvantages of growth to advance further because of super micro manage from team leaders and managements.
* we have a very young and inexperience leaderships w/ bad attitude (not fit in their role). Because of that many projects are LATE, micro manage to NOT important tasks and we missed out schedule
* our team leader and management often not at work office and hard to communicate, show up 20-30min late in their own meeting w/ smell, sweat workout clothes and we have to start all over because of his action.
* Third party rank and rate our internal employee survey are low in the 20%, but second & third line manager travel to Austin w/ many ignore and un-answer to our concerns. Perhaps, they just want to show to their VP and CEO that they did travel to Austin site and had a team out to team building activity (like painting and eat until 9p) but there was not much to address our concerns and issues.
* we work w/o a life at home and the additional team building until 9-10p is not acceptable. We are also have family to take care after work.
*annual salary was nearly stand still in the past several years. They don't see what we worked to dead, they used comments to us during the performance review that they don't applied to them.
* managements stick to good old boy systems.
* I love pet at home and not at work. People bring their dog to work that bark and smell like a zoo. I personally don't think it is a healthy to bring pets to work to distract people surrounding in the company
* you can not pass the parking lot w/o going thru a group of NVIDIA employees smoking by the building 
* we have lost number of employees because of these issues. They left w/o telling us onsite these issues are the problem.","* we would like our great CEO to flatten level of management (to many layer and politic) to stay focus with goal of programs/projects in order to achieve and get products out to the market successfully.
* NON of our team leaders and management have any idea to run projects smooth and on time. We are NEEDing bad of the real certified Program/Project team member to help and guide our team to run project w/ focus, clear issues from our engineers, keep schedule in place, etc...

People who work here are generally friendly and cooperative.

Thanks to the company's success in the market, morale at the company is generally very high.

Subject to the demands of your work (see Cons) you have a lot of flexibility over how you manage your time.

Compensation seems competitive for the industry.

The company is a good corporate citizen and does try to give back to the communities in which it operates.

There's a refreshing lack of bureaucracy at the company.

The free coffee on the Santa Clara campus is very good.","The company can be quite disorganized sometimes. Lack of proper planning, an aversion to process, and an overoptimistic approach to scheduling occasionally causes even the most mundane activity to degenerate into a firefight.

On some projects, management has the unreasonable expectation that staff be available 24/7. On one occasion I was pressured into cancelling my evening plans to finish an urgent update (which was ultimately delayed until the following week).

The professional time off policy for exempt staff means that all vacation time is taken at the employee's manager's discretion. The possibility that some crisis might erupt during time off makes it impossible to disconnect completely. The need to ask a co-worker to provide cover during time can make employees reluctant to take any time off at all.

The company does not always live up to the ideal of intellectual honesty cited as a factor in the company's recent success. In reality, sometimes employees who try to resist bad ideas are considered as ""poor team players"".","Special Relativity 101: The speed of light not just a speed limit.

The stock is on fire and everyone is thrilled about this. This is a great place to be if you are an intern, engineer, etc as NVIDIA is doing cutting-edge work that supports AI and Deep Learning industries. 

Some ability to work from home but it depends on your manager. Being able to do this infers a trust relationship between manager and report - this is on the wane. 

No vacation time here at NVIDIA. Instead, you can take what you need given your work load at the moment. Some folks put regular vacations on their calendar (a week every 3 or 4 months) just to make sure they're using their time off. Some folks abuse the heck out of this system. Many people will tend to check in while on vacation, never really disconnecting from work.","It is nearly impossible to grow your career here. Little opportunity or support for transferring into other departments or roles. 

Newer senior management are awash in politics and are more interested in building empires than in supporting their reports. 

No yearly cash bonus. Instead you get RSUs that vest over 4 years. If you contribute to your ESPP plan, they use that in factoring how much RSUs you get at focal review time. Not quite fair as ESPP is voluntary. and can change mid-period. 

Medical benefits are finally starting to compete with the rest of the valley but still lag on 401K contribution matching, cost of medical care for dependants, etc. 

Educational benefits at Stanford are primarily for CS, EE, EEE, AI majors. There is nothing for management or marketing professionals under this program. There is a separate program that covers just over $5000/year for other education, but this won't cover an MBA. It might cover one or 1.5 classes a year at Stanford. I haven't heard of anyone getting their MBA covered through NVIDIA like at other companies I've worked for.

Lunches are supposed to be subsidized, but it's less costly to go out to eat at a restaurant. No snacks provided. 

Because there is no official vacation time at NVIDIA, if you leave or are laid off and haven't used much vacation time, you've essentially lost it.

Meager to absent travel budgets. The management encourages those on global teams to just do video conferences to save money. CFO is constantly cutting costs and does a great job at this but sometimes we spend so much time on how to cut costs, or justifying expenses that we waste money in the lengthy discussion process.","To the e-staff & upper management:

Better support your non-technical staff on the education side. Don't be afraid of letting employees grow and learn. Support and encourage lateral moves more. We are more successful as a company when we learn and can better support each other.

Intellectual honesty is dying quickly as you bring in lots of middle and upper management from other companies that aren't aligned with our historical culture. 
These new hires aren't used to being honest about mistakes and lots is being swept under the carpet to keep you from seeing it. They don't want you to see where we're failing. The ""everything is roses"" song is getting old. You'd be surprised how much isn't working.

- Some good engineers are overloaded therefore not executing well or not leading who eventually fail.

Employees have a very positive and cheerful attitude because the company retains its startup flavor of being on a mission, and it values its people. The goodness comes from the top, with Jensen's unique brand of encouragement, humor, and a bit of fear mongering. Long-term vision based on principles is celebrated, and hard work is rewarded. Everything we do is cutting-edge, so the work is technically satisfying as well as being relevant. In my particular case, NVIDIA lets me work remotely, which few companies these days do. One other important aspect of NVIDIA worth mentioning is the openness toward respectful disagreement at every level. There is a strong belief that confronting challenges early is always better than hiding them, and all levels of management welcome hearing about issues from anyone. What more could you want?","The only thing I don't like very much is the vacation policy. There is no fixed schedule.

- We are a data based company and a very intellectually honest company. If we fail, we fail together, but we don't hind mistakes or make excuses. We learn why we made the mistake and we adjust.
- Down to earth people. During the development of a product, I had no issues getting our engineering SVP in a room to help make decisions and make the product a success.
- We have great leaders. 
- We are investing in productivity, and infrastructure to help us innovate. IT has not always been good and is not great yet, but is getting better so quickly. And we are building the most beautiful new HQ - Endeavor.
- Great ESPP
- Onsite perks are getting really good.
- Healthcare access is a priority 
- Parental leave is great
- Work-life balance is a priority
- We only hire great workers and for the most part human beings... :)"," We are growing very fast and it is challenging to fit everyone in from a facilities perspective. Meeting space is tight, but we have invested in meeting pods to help.

* Rare to encounter anyone who is ""phoning it in""; very efficient workplace and dedicated colleagues
* Execution speed is admirably fast; I'd be surprised if any peer company (e.g. Intel/AMD/Qualcomm) can deliver new products at NVIDIA schedules
* Flat hierarchy - titles are generally private, and authority comes from earned respect. The company is still small enough for individual contributors to get recognition from the top.
* Every year the company has improved and dealt with problems and deficiencies employees have brought up.","* Global offices and round-the-clock handoff means the work day never ends. It's only possible to unplug if you force yourself to, as there will always be more work than time.
* Constant feeling of being understaffed, even if that may not be accurate. Work is not always load-balanced well.
* Many teams appear to pile on a lot of technical debt and are unable to staff internal improvements.
* ""Speed of light"" schedules sometimes forget to account that we're not in a vacuum :)
* Used to be behind in perks, but that is improving, e.g. shuttle services. Food is slowly improving, although costs unlike some peer companies, and dinner food quality is awful. No snack options besides some antiquated vending machines.
* Conf call + webex setup feels antiquated. Behind on communications technologies, which is challenging when dealing with a global team. Progress is being made but it's slow.
* Underinvestment in social aspects: Rare for teams to ever go out or do team-building activities. Celebrations are rare. Alcohol-free campus dampens any relaxed communication. No holiday party (community service is the replacement, which is admirable, but can't think of why we can't do both...)","* Ensure that teams are staffing process improvements

Hard for some teams and people to preserve work/life balance. Some weekend work and email checking. Depends a lot of the team and person.
2. Only twice a year employee stock purchase plan, so if you join at the wrong time you get burned and don't get to participate for six months
3. Stock options are only selectively distributed based generally on how well you negotiated at hire, some people got good deals, other people got nothing, so get no benefit from the stock rally 
4. Office cubes can be a bit cramped, but at least it is not open office so one can concentrate with headphones on and its not too bad. Would be nice to have a bit more space and white noise though.
5. Promotions and bonuses only once per year. Twice per year would be nice.
6. Not much parking during peak times
7.

Its rightly categorized as a big startup. It is amazing to work here as things move at a reasonable speed and practical decisions are arrived at in almost no time. I also love the culture of being honest and straight where work has higher precedence then who proposes it. Move-on is the culture... :),Speed comes at its disadvantage of having to take many decisions and constant learning. This also adds to overall work which means you got to love your work else may cause frustration.,Overall there is less time to think about growth or ranks here but that's something most employees strive for.

Upward mobility is possible if you work hard and contribute game-changing ideas.
With the rise of AI, the company and it's employees are poised to do very well.
You can explore different areas of interest, and your manager can even lend you out to other teams for periods of time if you'd like.
Our benefits package is awesome.
The base salary is good.","We don't exactly get great discounts on our own company's products, which is a shame.
If you have to work on chip bringup, depending on your role, you may need to work 70+ hours per week for a few weeks.
There is no xmas or end of year bonus.","First, they took our options and replaced them with RSUs. That hurt. But when the CEO took our RSUs and replaced it with a much less valuable 'guaranteed annual base wage increase' program, many employees were devastated as our stock shot up into 100+ territory. That was a very terrible thing to do to us. We didn't deserve to have our RSUs taken away like that.

I've personally never heard of another company that even comes close to NVIDIA's student loan repayment program.","I have to preface my cons list by stating that NVIDIA excels in every area that truly counts: its culture, company values, leadership, my own career (and career development), and coworkers. Here's where I see room for improvement:
-Would love free lunch (it's already discounted, but hey, why not shoot for the stars); maybe replace Aramark with a different food vendor
