They have been so slow and unwilling to disrupt it that they would not budget properly to sell printers. And what happens when you don't sell low margin printers today? Yes, you guessed it. You don't sell high margin supplies tomorrow. And now those chickens have come home to roost. Layoffs of 7k-9k employees most likely on the print side coming in the next couple of years. HP has lost its way by hanging on to the old way of doing things. They don't innovate nor do they do what it takes to retain top talent. Fresh young talent is not offered stock. Get those golden handcuffs out, HP. Make it rewarding to stay and hard to leave. But without stock, anyone can be tempted to leave for nothing more than extra pay because we don't have to give up anything to go. By giving stock to everyone you will make it a lot harder to leave.

However, with all the profit printing cartridges have rung up over the years, HP management and CTO really failed to ever invest in the “next business.” 3D print may become a good business over time, but it cannot be the only business. For a company that has the muscle and makeup for building hardware, HP has been inept at acquiring or home-growing any growth businesses.","You have to make some calculated bets. 2D print is not going to return the same revenue and profit over the next 10+ years that it used to. Acquire a complementary hardware company in a growth area - is it a POS company, a media streaming company, an IOT play... I don’t know, but I’m hoping you do. Whatever you do, don’t go for anymore value plays - I.e., a company on the decline - palm was a garbage buy, Samsung laser printer business was mediocre. Be bold, be creative, let’s gamble now while we still have the chips rather than just die a slow death by 1000 tiny cuts.

Also, you really need to take a hard look at your management. People unwilling to change, stuck on the old ways, wanting to play it safe, cut them. Complacency is a slow-growing but fatal cancer that will kill a company. HP still has time, but that window is closing.

Sat Aug 10 2019 08:47:40 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),,, ,You’ll be just another cog in the gargantuan HP machine,I worked at HP Inc.,,"1. People. Coworkers were almost always great. 

2. Flexibility of work schedule. WFH and flexibility in working hours was great. 

3. Pay. I’ve yet to get a job that pays me even 64% if what I made at HP. 

4. Benefits Package. (PTO + insurance + retirement)

5. Company-provided equipment. (Laptops, monitors, etc) 

6. Empathy and compassion from management (depending upon your individual manager) if something tragic or traumatic happens. After the death of a parent, my boss let me take four weeks of paid bereavement leave that didn’t come out of my PTO balance.","1. The culture created by management. You’re just a cog in the gargantuan HP machine. HP cares not about your hopes and dreams or your career advancement. Even if you push hard for something like mentorship, which is something they promote, your requests will likely be ignored or pushed aside. 

2. Adherence to the bottom line creates job instability for employees. Sudden and unexpected layoff occur. I was “let go” and given fake reasons why. What it came down to was that I was laid off without HP calling it a lay-off so they didn’t have to report it, which would have been detrimental to the stock price. 

3. If you get laid off or let go, you won’t see it coming. I had a one-on-one scheduled with my manager. As we were walking to find a conference room, we chatted like it was any other day. Just chitchat. Then we walked into a conference room in a different building and he immediately hit me with the news I was being let go. When I questioned why, he gave me a made up reason related to my performance. When I challenged him and told me he was incorrect, he fumbled over his words and gave me a different reason that was equally made up. 

4. Lack of interaction with management. In the nearly five years I worked at HP, I can probably count on two hands the number of times I had real interaction (something beyond chitchat) with the two different managers for whom I worked. 

5. Also, if you accept a severance package, as I did, you will never be eligible for rehire. EVER. After working for HP for 4 years and just shy of 11 months, my severance package was a half a month’s pay, but no one ever told me I’d never be able to come back and my severance paperwork never indicated as much, either. 

6. Favoritism. This is definitely a problem. My first manager took the words of another person I worked with as the God’s honest truth when that person blamed me for a mistake she made. My manager never even asked me if I knew anything about the problem created by this other person. She just automatically assumed the problem arose because of me. I was told “you set us back weeks” after this other person mucked up some data she was analyzing for a new metric. This other person had asked me to look at the data and run a test, which I did exactly as she asked me to. I ran the test on literally 100 rows out of 100,000 rows for approximately 15 minutes and didn’t save anything. My second manager played favorites and I felt as if I had been “left behind” (for lack of a better term) while the other new hires I worked with were brought along much more quickly than I was. The other two new people on the team were given special treatment and paid special attention that I wasn’t. It helped if you were an athlete of some kind or if you liked mountain biking. That helped you “fit in” with the little clique created by my manager. Apparently I didn’t “fit in” because I didn’t join them on their mountain biking trek or their whitewater rafting trip one summer.",Shift a lot of your focus from stakeholders to employees. You’ll be more successful in the long run. Open the lines of communication and help employees achieve success.,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0

Although tolerable at first, it seemed like a variety of antisocial behaviors and ongoing harassment were commonplace and becoming worse to the point where I developed serious concerns with the ethics of the company. Based on my experiences towards the end I can't recommend anyone work for this company or support HP Inc. in any way, especially if you are differently-abled. I would not feel at all safe allowing my child to be an intern at the site I worked at and it scares me that people as young as high school age were being exposed to this environment. 

The workplace itself could be described as dingy, crowded, and cluttered which did nothing to help the generally poor environment. HP seems to have fully bought into the idea of a temporary workforce and what seemed like constant restructuring and employment thrash made this a particularly soulless place to be. The best, most talented, and generally nicest people tended to do their time and leave, to be replaced with ever-poorer quality people in a depressing race to the bottom.","Make some token effort to hire decent people.

Culture is very supportive and cognizant of inclusion and recognition. They also treat you like an adult, and as long as you get your work done nobody is really clock-watching and you have flexibility to manage personal needs with business ones. I'm an old timer, going back to the Compaq days, and the current work environment is the best I have experienced in my 20+ years with the company.","No macro level cons, but as I am sure it is with any company, an individual job or role can have drawbacks: Some require extensive travel, since we are an international company some require calls at very odd hours, emergencies regarding product quality or supply issues can break out which can translate to very intense periods of long days until the situation is resolved. I'm sure there are some turd managers here and there, but from what I have seen they are not tolerated very long and get sorted out. But there are no overall ""Company Cons"" that come to mind (and keep in mind, I am an old Coot and usually pretty cynical, so for me to be this positive says something!).","Keep up the good work. Appreciate and support the movement to try to bring younger talent in the company, but be sure to continue to value and recognize wisdom and experience of your experienced employees. I would say challenge your mindset on what business we are in....it should not be viewed as the ""printers and computers"" business....we are in the ""image and information"" business and so developing new products/services/opportunities should flow from that mindset(e.g. people haven't stopped printing as many pictures...people have new ways to view images. There are more new images created now than ever before...what can we do to make these accessible to people?).

Also, working around some very talented people encourages growth. For newer employess, HP can be a great learning opportunity working alongside these veterans. After about five years, it is usually time to move on to another company where you can have some assurance of more steady career paths.

Upper management strives to provide solid financial stability to the company.","Upper management treats the workforce as interchangeable cost units that can be moved from country to country. This means that you can be layed off (WFR) at a moments notice regardless of how talented or how much you contribute to the company. The depersonalization is such that people are not really called people by management they are called TCOW's(total cost of workforce -- permanent) and RCOW's (resource cost of workforce -- contractors). When the word comes down from on high to cut your TCOWs you have to do so regardless of how good the people are that are working for you. As you read the reviews you will notice a very different set of reviews depending which country the review is from.

Management creates quite a bit of PR about how they value talent within HP, but the lack of training and/or apprenticeship opportunities to develop people into new or changing roles is almost non-existent. It is pretty much limited to the occasional quarterly class on management processes or access to Linked-In learning. There is tuition reimbursement but it takes a serious commitment to a program before you can use it.

Volunteer programs / Classes / Employee events
Flexible work environments","HP has shown an increasing inclination towards outsourcing work to 3rd party houses or their China campus. Many jobs are being sent overseas while qualified Americans are being caught up in ""workforce reductions"".
There is no stability in HP. In the 10 years I was there I went through multiple restructures and mass layoffs. HP has a tendency to alternate between contracted labor and permanent employees with layoffs in between. 
If you are contract, be aware there is a forced 3 week unpaid shutdown during Christmas.
If you are perm, be aware that if you are caught up in one of HP's workforce reductions, there is a strict no-rehire policy. In my case, HP just purchased a new campus in Spring TX and was preparing to move to the new building. We were all assigned desks and I actually bought a house and moved my family closer to the new campus. Two weeks before the building move a large group of us were ""reduced"". We had all been given excellent reviews, the budget seemed fine, and the reason given was a need to ""refresh the talent pool"". We were given a severance package and 60 days (during a forced holiday shutdown) to find a job within the company. Since most of us were unable to obtain new positions that quickly especially during a forced shutdown, we are no longer able to work at HP either as contractors or permanent employees with no timeline restrictions. Take caution if moving your family!","HP is an American company that should invest primarily in supporting the American workforce. Please do not continue to send jobs overseas just to reduce the bottom line. We keep hearing about how great HP is doing as far as market share and finances but so many jobs that could be filled locally are not, all for the sake of the budget.
