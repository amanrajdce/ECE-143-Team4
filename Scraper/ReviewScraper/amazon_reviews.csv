You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things. The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring. I've often called Amazon my ""Sexy Mistress...she's emotionally abusive, but she's so sexy that I go back for more punishment.""","The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager. I've seen too much ""behind the wall"" and hate how our individual performers can be treated. You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking.","Don't pretend that the recent NY Times article was all about ""isolated incidents"". The culture IS abusive and it WILL backfire once stock value starts to drop. I'm an 8 year veteran and I no longer recommend former peers to interview with Amazon.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0
Fri Feb 23 2018 13:41:40 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Software Development Manager,"Phoenix, AZ",Current Employee ,An Amazing Place to Work,I have been working at Amazon full-time for less than a year,743,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Tue Dec 17 2013 12:31:58 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Software Development Manager,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,"Can be amazing for some people, horrible for others",I have been working at Amazon full-time for more than 3 years,1385,"Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too. There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
 - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
 - A chance to make a huge difference
 - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
 - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
 - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain"," You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.","Stack ranking is a horrible practice since it's rife with favoritism. It's also not Amazonian in that it's not data based (arbitrarily designating a certain percentage of employees that must be put on performance management isn't a data driven criterion) and it's not frugal (effectively forcing an individual out of the company in one division who would make the grade in another is either retaining someone who doesn't meet the bar or a waste of talent). The goal is to force managers to actually make the hard decisions about how their team members compare with each other (not everyone can be exceptional), but it has more defects than virtues. Replace it with a common comparison of each person against the bar for their position, based on data. The percentages that are assigned to each performance category will turn out how they turn out, but there will be an evaluation mechanism that's fair and frugal.",4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
Thu Mar 23 2017 08:51:55 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),,"Seattle, WA",Former Employee ,We are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors,I worked at Amazon full-time for more than 5 years,553,This company gets A list performance from C list employees. The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey. This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon. The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.","Bezos you bought the Washington Post and hired Jay Carney to be your PR head. There is nothing I can write here that you would deign listen to, because you are a hack. You must be mad that Expedia beat you to the punch and hired Chelsea Clinton to serve on their board of directors.

For those grasping Weasels that have squirmed and back stabbed your way to success, you know who you are. You won't care what is written here because ""You got yours, Eff them.""

For those truly diligent and hard working employees that don't want to believe the story from NY times that called Amazon a ""Snake Pit"" because you don't want to think you actually are involved in such a dystopian landscape of anti-business ethics: ""Always yell with the crowd. It is the only means to be safe.""",4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0

I started in Finance and although I was good at it, I did not enjoy it as much as I believed I should. I then pursued Program Management and later Product Management, where I found my passion. The great thing about Amazon is that internal transfers are not only expected, but encouraged. I personally move about every 3 years, but the duration one stays in a role greatly varies across the company. It's all about continuing to learn, feeling there is meaning in what you are doing, and finding things you are passionate about. Your time at Amazon will be what you make of it. I enjoy working with extremely intelligent people on a daily basis and the ability to take full ownership of my work. I should mention that I am a mother of two children and have great work-life balance.","The Day 1 culture at Amazon means many things, but one of them is solving new industry problems. If you are not comfortable with ambiguity and solving problems that have never been encountered before (to your knowledge), you may not enjoy working at Amazon. Depending on your role, I have heard that work-life balance can be more challenging for those starting early in their careers and looking to move up the ladder quickly. However, if you set expectations with your manager with open conversations about your desired flexibility, you will likely find an arrangement that works for you. Work-life balance is something you create for yourself as a priority, it is not automatically handed to you.","I've been fortunate to always have a great manager at Amazon, but I've seen others that do not. Your relationship with your manager will be a major factor in your enjoyment at work. IE: micro-managing vs empowerment, etc. For this reason, I'd encourage management to be open to feedback and reflect on your management style. Sometimes what you mistake for a weakness in your team's ability to deliver results could actually reflect a weakness in your management style. If you see high turnover in your team, perhaps take some time to reflect on your own actions rather than assuming they were 'not a good fit for the role.'",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

The hiring bar is extremely high, so everyone is extremely talented. Amazon VP's are some of the smartest people you will ever meet. The whole company moves so quickly that every day you are working on a new major initiative. The leadership principles are literally used everyday - people quote them in meetings, and the company only focuses on customers, never on competitors. It's quite remarkable. If you get an offer to work at Amazon, take it.","I stayed for over 6 years which put me above 98% of other Amazonians (there's a tool called ""oldfart"" that compares your tenure to other employees). Most people only last 2-3 years for several reasons. First, the pace is relentless which at first is exhilarating but becomes downright fatiguing. Second, Amazon doesn't really care about you as a person - only as a productive cog in the machine. Third, the RSU award program is ok, but total comp is really only great if the stock is climbing 30% a year. Finally, everyone wants to hire an ex-Amazonian right now. When you combine these, Amazon becomes an amazing training ground, but not a great place to stay long-term.","Amazon comp is decent, but many other top tier companies can match it with better benefits. PTO is weak and employee perks like discounts are non-existent. The 401(k) is limited and many other companies offer better stock vesting plans. Despite attempted reforms, end-of-year ratings are problematic and promotions are far too bureaucratic.",4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

Do not hire high functioning, licensed professionals for work that does not require that license, and then use the fact that the job description does not technically require said license as a reason for slower promotions.

Presumably licensed professionals in non-license required jobs nevertheless have the same bills as other people with those licenses (e.g., student loans.)

- 3 day weekend, work 4 ten hour shifts. More time for yourself!
- easy but just a lot of work to do, BUT that makes the day go by faster 
- the higher up’s are always so friendly and helpful. Loved every one of my AM’s and PA’s. OP’s were wonderful too
- For your first four weeks, you attend a class once a week hosted by HR where you can ask and talk about pretty much anything. This is awesome for newcomers
- HR also throws you “birthday parties.” 
- learned how to properly lift and use box cutter, which is extremely useful in real life
- you can use your time off anytime you want and they won’t question you about it.
- You have sick time, unpaid time, paid time off, and vacation time 
- set schedule
- benefits are great 
- perks are great! I got free tickets to a local water park and I believe you get discount for Verizon or some phone company too. They have discounts for pretty much everything. You just have to look it up. 
- they accept pretty much anyone. Didn’t go through an interview. 
- pay is good. $15 all around the nation is not bad. If you live near a big city, you get paid more. Got paid $15.70 since Seattle was next to us. 
- great career opportunities. Within working for a few months, they asked me if I wanted to be a learning ambassador, which is great start if you want to work your way up. Know a guy who became PA within just a few months as well

Honestly not a bad company. Worked here for a year. Left because my husband got stationed in Hawaii and there’s no amazon here unfortunately. That would’ve been awesome though"," long hours of heavy lifting back to back
- super sore coming home from every shift. Would not recover until two days into my weekend
- long hours. Show up to work when it’s still dark outside. By the end of your shift, it’s still dark. Come home, can’t really eat a big dinner or spend time with family because you need to go to bed right when you get home. Feels like your day is already wasted. 
- you gain 10 hours of paid time off once you work 350 hours. That’s very little for all that time you worked",,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Amazing ability to build your own career, if you are lucky enough to have Amazonian leadership.","New management is far from Amazonian, and those who have been at the company longer are underpaid and under valued. Bad leadership is tolerated, if not rewarded, while being Amazonian gets you labeled at a “trouble maker”.","Review your teams, look at those who have been at the company 5+ years, and ask “why haven’t they been promoted, and why are they paid less than my new hires”, and then fix it.
