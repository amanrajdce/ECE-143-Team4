- Growth potential is based on org/company impact . This is unfairly tied directly to a manager's ability to plan and defend funding of IC resources to work on impact creating opportunities.",Consider career growth KPIs to account for a teams ability to make impact.

Their lack of experience shows and is only compounded by high school-like bonding/favoritism of individuals off their teams. Be ready to join many pointless happy hours to become well-liked by your manager... or suffer being handed a bad territory of accounts. 

If you're an experienced salesperson, it may not be the best company. The company is product-centric, not sales and service-centric. Means you will spend a lot of time working around the nuances of administrative tasks like billing issues, contract creation, customer service (virtually nonexistent Customer Success team), navigating the outdated CRM process, creating client presentation collateral (subpar product marketing team), broken dashboards, etc. 

The best way to be successful is get a lucky account/territory that is bound to grow a lot or simply put your head down and take ownership to work through all the sales productivity gaps. Important to note that there is a ""sales productivity"" team, but nobody knows what they do and there is zero way for the sales organization to provide feedback to help improve the very apparent issues. 

Overall, if you want to have flashy Instagram posts and free beer on Thursdays, LinkedIn is an amazing place to work. If you're a salesperson seeking a fulfilling, sustainable career, it's best to search elsewhere.","Just leave. You are the issue.

Truly believe upper management leads with compassion and transparency which is evident in company decisions, communication, and does trickle down the corporate ladder effectively.","Horrible middle management. Good to great sales reps do not always equate to good management. I left the company due to a continued negative experience with both my direct manager and management within my organization and saw little response and action from our Director to address said challenges. While there will always be disagreements and personality mismatches, I am confident that I am not the only one who shares this viewpoint given the 50%+ attrition within our direct org. The sad part is that the team I was on was not at as bad as other teams within our organization led by first time managers who cannot relate to people and were not a top performing rep prior to moving to management.

I (and others) began losing faith in the company as a whole when feedback given at time of the EVS, along with skip level conversations, were never acted upon and inappropriate behavior continued to persist on a daily basis. 

Having been with the company for quite a few years leaving was not easy. But when you mix in inconsistent quality in middle management, along with an ever-growing belief that the louder, ""Cheerleaders"", on the floor are the only ones getting support from management, you have a toxic situation that has led to people leaving, in masses.","Listen to your direct reports. Don't stop at listening, actually act before all of your mindshare leaves in the next 2 months. Listening is great at first, but when nothing changes after a few months, efforts of gaining feedback are seen as nothing but insincere corporate jargon. Stop promoting people into management that have no right holding that title.

This is a high turnover company. Account Executives are constantly in and out with no way to move internally. 

In the last year I have seen 6 very skilled sales people leave due to high quotas, poor leadership, and not being able to move up in the org. Every team from time to time will have a ""plus one"" on their team. This person is there to help the team while another person is put on plan for not hitting their quota. While this is set up to be a learning role it ends up being a reminder that someone is there to take your spot at anytime. 

Account Executives did make a lot of money when quotas were attainable, but with the Microsoft Acquisition quotas went up and more people were hired. This created less opportunity for everyone and it doesn't look to be slowing down. 

The Role: 
This role is a Sales Development role primarily. You will spend most of your day prospecting out of an excel doc. 

The sales process is easy. The tools sell themselves and you just need to find the people who can afford this solution. 

Leadership: 
There is a a lot of time put in to learning and developing. If you are lucky to have a manager who has been here a while you will get a great learning experience. If you have a new manager this is going to be much harder. Most of the people who have left have had new managers who weren't properly trained to develop people or work with them.

The Right Fit: 
Currently in Sales Development or SMB sales and killing it. You are used to a high quota and a transactional sale. Maybe you have some customer service experience as well. This will come in handy as you do need to hand hold clients and get them using the products correctly. You are not looking to move up while at the company and know going in that you will have the same role for as long as you are here. Expect to make 80K/ year all in",Hire managers who have sold a similar tool and could sell it themselves. If a manager can't sell the product they can't coach their team to do it.

Wed Jan 02 2019 15:17:01 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Product Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Business Product Manager - Sales Productivity Operations,I worked at LinkedIn full-time for more than a year,34,"LinkedIn:

- Benefits are great. Free healthcare, food, unlimited PTO
- Top talent; very smart and engaging professionals
- Industry leader with sizable market share
- Beautiful offices with snacks, great conference rooms etc.
- Incredible mission statement and enterprise wide supported objective to provide economic opportunity to the entire global workforce
- Top of the line senior executives. Jeff Weiner may just be one of the best CEOs in the country

Sales Productivity Operations:

- Front line employees (Associates, BPMs, etc) are incredible people. Smart, easy to work with, collaborative and goal oriented
- The ability to streamline and improve the sales experience is a leading edge position
- Horizontal in nature therefore you are exposed to several LOBs and other sales focused teams","LinkedIn:

- From a talent and recruiting perspective, the company is overly focused on individuals with brand names on their resume... Many talented professionals are ignored because they didn't attend a certain university or work at an industry leading firm prior. Additionally, there appears to be a very large emphasis on hiring young and avoiding older applicants
- Young, aggressive and somewhat political. You'll never escape corporate politics, however due to the target recruiting demo, political posturing and in-authenticity is fairly prevalent as young professionals are looking to make big moves early in their career. Major power brokers are usually people who are able to navigate the political landscape seamlessly which typically requires a person who is unafraid to self promote while stepping on peers in the process. In addition, self recognition is encouraged and creates a weird, tacky non stop elevator pitch that you see bleed over onto the platform
- Over diversified product. Way too many irons in the fire which dilutes the effectiveness of the product which provides a platform experience that is 'meah' when it should be revolutionary. The focus seems to be oriented towards a jack of all trades master of none approach
- Pay is slightly below mean for the industry

Sales Productivity Operations:

- Poor leadership. Whoever established the Sales Productivity Operations (SPO) org (still very new org) appointed leaders with pedigree and really impressive resumes. Unfortunately EQ and leadership abilities were completely overlooked. Point of fact, one key leader has had countless HR complaints and has weekly coaching sessions on how to better connect with people... At this level, these skills should be table stakes, not something you have to coach and coax. Interactions with some of the key leaders range from 1 on 1s with eye rolls, frequent interruptions, excessive phone usage while others are talking, laughter at suggestions, belittling in front of peers and micromanagement to the Nth degree. Put simply, the key leaders inside of SPO are a complete nightmare to work for. When you tell people who you work for outside of the org, the reaction is typically the same - empathy and offers to help facilitate inner company transfer.
- Toxic environment. As a result of the leadership, Product Managers are not encouraged to think or act independently. Strategy and execution are both dictated to you. Retention reflects the environment as the org has trouble keeping butts in seats longer than 6 months. As an example we had a top tier Senior Manager who decided to leave after 6 months, mainly because they were miserable working for SPO leadership.
- Over reliance on the consulting skill set. Since SPO leaders have top 3 consulting firm experience, there is an over reliance on getting people in from similar a background. As a result, it creates an echo chamber and a superficial problem solving modality - throw it on a slide, use some of that sexy consulting jargon and move on. Thought and strategy that approach the root of an issue or objective are not encouraged. This in effect, impacts the output of a diverse workplace as it does the opposite of what is intended - creates group think.","I am willing to admit that myself and my fellow co-workers in SPO likely had a very unique experience, not akin to what the true culture of LinkedIn is championed to be. That being said, after all of the complaints, the blatantly poor talent retention data points and employee voice surveys that suggest SPO employees are not very happy, I am disappointed that business continues to be conducted as usual. Someone in a position further up the latter has to be remotely aware of the issues and is either unable or unwilling to make a change. 

Direct message to senior GSO leaders: You have the info at hand. Don't let ineffective leaders railroad efforts to create an inclusive and enjoyable environment that LinkedIn strives so hard to instill. Numbers don't lie. Look at the retention issue and employee voice survey results.",3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0

Sat Dec 22 2018 22:45:06 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Account Executive,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,It is a disservice to give anything less than 5 stars.,I have been working at LinkedIn full-time for more than a year,9,"To start, I should first mention that I have never written a Glassdoor review for any company I have worked for, but I had to make an exception - you'll see why. Before I begin my review, I should first give some background about how I landed at LinkedIn.

I quit my previous job out of sheer disgust of how poorly run an organization it was. It was a company that had leadership with poor transparency, an antiquated product, and a poor career growth outlook.

As I was considering my next step, I found that I had two job offers at the same time: One from LinkedIn and another from a startup. I spent hours and hours going through Glassdoor reviews of LinkedIn, weighing the pros and cons of joining a large company vs a smaller company. At first, I was leaning heavily towards the startup- it's the dream isn't it?? You get in when it is a small size, get promoted more quickly as the company grows and cash out big. 

That's the dream at least. Although I plan on joining a startup one day, most of my friends who are currently working at a startup will tell you that the reality is that most startup careers don't follow that journey, for one reason or another. As I approach my one-year mark at LinkedIn I look back at my decision to join LinkedIn as the single greatest decision I have ever made in my entire professional career. Period.

Why? Let's start with culture. This is a company that has, despite its large growth in headcount over the last few years, SOMEHOW managed to maintain an extremely positive, friendly, energetic, and downright FUN culture that is BETTER than most startups. It goes SO strongly against the stigma of a mundane, lifeless, corporate vibe that I always incorrectly assumed engulfed companies as they get larger. Boy was I wrong there... End of quarter is literally amazing. I closed a deal, spun a wheel, and won my entire team a round of mimosas. On my way back to my desk I passed a cart with people handing out food and blasting celebratory music. 

Second and most importantly: When you join a startup, your growth is limited, for the most part, to the effectiveness and competency of the one VP/manager you work for. When you speak with LinkedIn employees, you will constantly hear talk about how incredibly high-caliber and intelligent every employee and manager is that works there. LinkedIn is selective. And the sales managers at LinkedIn are legitimately some of the best sales minds on the planet. More time-tested managers, combined with world-class peer talent means one thing: more readily available collaboration to bolster your personal and professional growth. 

Third: Perks. The treatment I receive makes me feel like royalty. I get a freshly catered, free breakfast every day, a freshly catered free lunch every day, an in-house barista who makes me an amazing latte every day, and a kitchen stocked with literally everything. Oh and I forgot - FREE health insurance. Yup. FREE. In addition, $2,000 EVERY YEAR of flex dollars you can spend towards wellness (gym memberships, personal trainer). LinkedIn always has your back and has you covered... And I can also tell you that when you get treated like a serious professional, you start working more and more like a serious professional. I can go on about the perks, but I think you get the idea.

Fourth: Best-in-class leadership. Witnessing this has been such a relieving contrast to the poor leadership I experienced in my previous company. Leadership does everything right. If there is a new policy they make and they hear negative feedback, they make adjustments and do so transparently. When things are going well revenue-wise, they use it effectively to boost morale. If there is a stretch of things not going well revenue-wise, they remain positive, they remain professional, and they always succeed in helping us keep the bigger picture in mind.

At the end of the day this is a company that does everything right. Their attention to achieving excellence in every last detail of every part of the business, from culture to operations to coaching to feedback loops to employee recognition - is unparalleled to anything I have ever seen. Shame on anyone giving LinkedIn less than 5 stars.","My biggest hesitation in joining a larger company was stagnated career growth. I was worried it would take me years and years and years to get promoted compared to a startup. Biggest irony, fast forwarding one year, is that I could care less. Why? Because of all the reasons outlined above, I am so focused on being better at my current role and continuing to grow, my title is the last thing on my mind. I'm not seeking a promotion because after being exposed to so many talented reps, I realize that I'm not ready! And that's fine. Makes me wonder how many unqualified people in startups get promoted even when they have gaps in their selling abilities, and then teach newer, impressionable reps suboptimal ways of selling as a result...

In approaching my one year mark, I have not been promoted, but I haven't viewed that as a con. Longer promotion time is what you sign up for when you join any larger company, but what is considered a ""con"" to some people, doesn't really matter to me.",Change nothing.,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

There are tens of overlapping projects, few of which are maintained, all of which were originally designed to replace all the others, and yet none of which can be removed or replaced. The IT team largely lacks effective leadership, and has a three-month horizon (anything that will take longer than three months is automatically squashed as being impractical, will never get done, etc.). There is no overall view of goals, or where things are ultimately headed, other than ""break things, get stuff done, and have fun.""",Effective leadership in the IT realm would make a huge difference.

I made lifelong friends and family at LinkedIn. I believe LinkedIn has the best of intentions when it comes to the Employee Resource Groups that promote diversity and inclusion. Overall the leadership is incredible and Jeff is an inspirational leader. I loved that LinkedIn was always thinking 5 steps ahead and always thinking about how to innovate their products.

Amazing benefits and compensation! The benefits across the board were incredible from 401k, stocks, health, wellness and perk-up, as well as mat/pat leave.","While innovation is wonderful, you can't forget about the products that got you to where you are. I don't feel that resources were adequately aligned to older product lines in the talent solutions space. Constant site outages and product issues with Recruiter and Jobs.

-Quotas are ridiculously high and difficult to hit especially in the talent solutions space. There are HUNDREDS of competitors and though LinkedIn has a great product, the competition is gaining traction. This should be accounted for in quotas. Be prepared to sell against a lot of companies and to lose budget to newcomers like ZipRecruiter/Muse. 

-You will maintain the same book of accounts which is great for building relationships with customers however your quotas will still rise even if your book is tapped.

-There is no work life balance, too many product trainings, middle management is wishy washy and there is little to no consistency across the board with performance standards.

-Tenured upper management resigned consistently the last few months I worked there which to me was concerning. There was no room for them to grow and the culture changed from what it once was.

-Lots of red tape since being acquired by Microsoft but thats to be expected.","I was lucky to have some great managers at LinkedIn but that's it...I was lucky. Had I been on a few other teams, I would have left a lot sooner. Your sales managers are the backbone of your organization and if you hire sales managers that have no experience selling LinkedIn, it's difficult for them to understand why their teams might be missing their quotas and be able to coach a struggling rep. 

Remember that LinkedIn is NOT the end all be all. It's unrealistic to think that customers would only allocate budget to LinkedIn (I'm not kidding, this conversation was brought up a multitude of times). Often sales management's response to losing budget would be that we weren't selling our value prop well enough. There are hundreds of companies entering the talent landscape and it's extremely difficult to sell against these other companies that have offerings at a lower price with equal results to LinkedIn. 

While I understand it's important to increase quota, it's also important to consider that a large percentage of your sales reps aren't hitting goal. I believe that should be taken more seriously when assigning annual quotas.

Get more clear on your performance standards and what would put an RM on a plan or not. Your teams are consistently scared for their jobs.",4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

I love the management philosophy of Leadership, Leverage, Results. Early on in every position, the employee is asked ""what is your next play."" The company is always looking to determine your next role and opportunity.","LinkedIn hires on pedigree and age. Most managers are under 30, directors are under 40, and anyone over 40 is a rarity. Important positions will be staffed based on the university the employee graduated from, rather than work experience. Sales process is being created by recent Ivy League grads who have never sold. Some sales and service director positions have been filled with individuals who are extremely smart but have limited to no experience selling and retaining. The attitude is if you are smart, you can lead any team no matter if you have zero experience doing your staff's actual trade. 

The millennial focus is highlighted in many aspects of the culture. At the 2016 global sales organization meeting, messaging was all about ""you are the best-of-the-best"" and that LinkedIn would not be successful without the individual job you do. Top performers were highlighted in front of thousands of employees. As the employee came to the stage to receive their well deserved award, videos of colleagues commending them were shown. Interspersed among work-centric kudos, the awardee's parents were shown in the videos congratulating their child and stating how proud they were of them. For a non-millennial, it was weird to see their parents congratulating their kid in a work setting. But this is also a company who holds Bring Your Parents to Work Day.","LinkedIn has worked hard and succeeded at creating a diverse company in regards to race, women in tech, gender in leadership, veterans, and sexual orientation.

If you are Asian or Caucasian, it's very likely that you'll experience the same reverse discrimination I faced during my time at LinkedIn. I sat through countless ""diversity"" talks and felt increasingly excluded from LinkedIn's hallmark ""inclusive culture."" At LinkedIn, there's a stark difference between invisible diversity and celebrated diversity. The celebrated diversity here is race.. the invisible diversity here is socioeconomic status, sexuality, academic background and age. LinkedIn will shove a narrative down your throat that encourages you to feel immense guilt and shame if you're a ""privileged race."" News flash, being Asian doesn't mean I'm automatically privileged. 

Not surprisingly, this leaks into your opportunities for great projects and promotion. I was told by management to underperform towards my quota-carrying role because it promoted unhealthy competition against less privileged teammates - in that case, salary me and I will happily underperform.

Speaking of salary - don't expect to make a high one here. They consistently underpay the market because they want ""people who love LinkedIn for the opportunity and not the money."" I'll never forget the number of entry-level hires that told me they were working Uber, Taskrabbit, or depending on their parents to afford to live in the city.",Pay a fair market rate ... invest in your talent.. start thinking about diversity more dynamically,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0

The BLP-GS program is a reflection of LinkedIn's great culture. It's a glorified corporate summer camp, full of bonding activities and events.","The BLP leadership team wants to attract top talent around the country. However, they do little to retain that talent. The BLP program scams college students every year, promising interesting projects and career development. This program is glorified sales funnel. The recruiters will tell you that you have the career mobility to work for a non-sales team and even convert full-time to marketing, operations, or talent strategy. However, this is less than 10% of each class. You'll be pressured to move into a sales team for a full-time offer as well as threatened to be moved unwillingly to Chicago (their sales hub). In Sales Development, you'll do the same thing over and over, 100+ times a day, every day. All the Sales Dev associates are extremely burnt out, bored, and unengaged. The only thing that keeps the sales machine going is LinkedIn's larger company culture. The compensation reflects how much the company values you... and most associates are supported by their parents because they cannot afford SF rent on the salary. If you want to keep great, top talent... give them interesting projects and the opportunity to have a meaningful impact on the company. BLP knows they can no longer recruit from top universities because these graduates almost always find better opportunities elsewhere. They've started to look at lower tier universities to increase their retention.",Hire more non-engineering students outside of the BLP program. I promise that there's a plethora of great talent that would love to work in non-sales teams and drive high impact.,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0

- Commuter Benefits (free CalTrain pass, shuttles) 
- Flexible work schedule -- a lot of managers do not sit in your office (obviously, depends on the organization you are in) so they are flexible about WFH as long as you are performing your job
- Salary is decent (not the most competitive or the highest.... but it's offset by all the perks you get from the company)"," For a company that is in the talent business - helping people find jobs -we are really bad about internal movement to different organizations/roles. It's extremely difficult, and there is no bias towards internal candidates. They essentially want someone who already has done the job vs looking at transferable skills and keeping talent at LinkedIn. It's a real bummer, as this is a key reason why great talent have left LinkedIn to pursue their dream job at competitor companies that were willing to ""take a chance"" on them.
- A lot of ""high performers""/""high achievers"" have left the company, so the leftover employees are mostly there just to do their job and go home. Not that this is necessarily a CON - but just something to point out. If you are looking to really learn and grow - fast - this is not the place for you.

I have worked at other tech companies and I can say that this company spoils their employees with some really great perks and there are a few things I like about working here such as:

-Amazing health insurance for my family
-PerkUp credit to be used annually on a number of pre-approved items (gym membership, massages, child care, home cleaning)
-Free breakfast/lunch/snacks 
-Opportunities to travel (if that's your thing)
-Women in management positions 
-Working for a well respected brand 
-Discretionary time off
-Awesome maternity/paternity leave policy
-Pay is above average","The downside of working at LinkedIn is that I quite literally have to sacrifice my work/life balance and sanity for the perks mentioned above.

-Onboarding did not prepare me at all to work at LinkedIn or my role
-Very little training for new hires. You are thrown in and expected to just figure it out.
-Poor communication across teams in multiple offices
-Long hours (although they will blame it on your lack of time management)
-My particular team is incredibly difficult as a working parent 
-DTO is nice but missing days does nothing but hurt you
-Even when I am not working, I'm constantly stressed about work
-Everyone made a big deal about InDays when I started as a day that you can take off and focus on the theme of the month but my team does not participate.
-My role is more of a sales position than a customer success position
-Doesn't feel like there are many opportunities in the Chicago office to grow

The culture on my team is very different than what I have heard at large at LinkedIn, which is unfortunate, as I feel like I have a very different perception of the company. From my first week of training, I felt that coming here was a mistake because I was forgotten about and not prepared to do my job.

I left a very enjoyable job that did not pay as well to come to LinkedIn and it feels like I have given up my peace of mind for more money. Not a great feeling.","Make sure your employees feel prepared before putting them on the phone with clients
