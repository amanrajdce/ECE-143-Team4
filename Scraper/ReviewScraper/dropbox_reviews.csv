Great benefits including health, dental, vision, commuter subsidy, cell phone, health/wellness subsidy, and more. Outside of work specialty events such as company picnic and holiday party were a blast. Great support teams for employee on-boarding. Fun work environment and great community of people to work around.","Don't let the food distract you from what is going on. I was merely hired as a diversity box to check. Upper level leadership states that diversity and inclusion are ""important"" and a ""high-priority"" but in researching the trends of POCs and women in the Dropbox workplace, you will see that there are major swings, not allowing for POCs to get comfortable in the workplace. You will also be paid less than your counterparts who are in the same role, with the same level of experience but display a less diverse demographic background. ERGs were great to find community in but that message needs to not only be a safe space to find community but it should mean something to upper level leadership. 

Dropbox promotes people into positions of power who have never lead a team before and who should never be allowed the opportunity to offer guidance to other human beings. There is zero intention behind the hiring and separation process which directly displays the patriarchal, ""Boy's Club,"" stigma of the Bay Area Tech Industry.

If you want to make an impact here, I highly suggest knowing someone higher up and not deviating from their ideologies. New and differing ideas are not welcomed from my understanding.

There is also not a very clear direction that this product is heading in. There are multiple different value propositions, giving employees the feeling of having their hands in too many buckets at one time. There is also no clarity on who to turn to when trying to problem solve.","Be intentional about your hiring and promotion process. Often times length of service, age, traditional tech industry demographics, or technical acumen does not directly correlate to high quality leadership.

TLDR: Dropbox, by far, was for me the best candidate experience, and after I was hired, my onboarding was thoughtful, seamless, reasonably paced, and there were no culture shocks or surprises—everybody has been so kind; also, Dropbox has awesome values that put people first (both employees and users). 

+ The recruiter was exceptionally kind and thoughtful, as well as deeply knowledgeable about their area of focus. They were genuinely advocating for me every step of the interview process. 

+ The general approach and philosophy was assessing mutual fit, both for culture and for the technical aspects of the role I was applying for. It was explained that this was a conversation, and there was no rush to get me through the funnel. This was awesome because many other companies play the numbers game and just try to get people through. Dropbox's approach feels more human and respectful.

+ Every interview I met with throughout my interview process was engaging, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and attentive. I've been in interviews at other companies where people are literally falling asleep in our 1:1 or on their phone during my presentation.

+ The documentation and resources are extensive and well organized. For new employees, there's a good balance between in-person instruction/coaching/onboarding and self-serve.

+ The benefits are outstanding. Probably some of the best in the industry.

+ Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion seems to be real here, and not just paid PR lip service.

+ Dropbox does seem to value work/life balance.

+ Dropbox has a clear leveling system with a clear career framework for assessing real business impact as a way to objectively promote employees.","+ Like all companies, Dropbox isn't a perfect machine, and every team is different. So, you should be prepared to come in with fresh eyes, get to know your team's strengths and weaknesses, and bring your expertise to bear on processes and collaboration.

Tuck Shop food is really good. The Wellness Benefit is large and you can use it on a very wide variety of equipment and services. Company matches donations up to a certain amount.

HelloSign Acquisition
The company may have realized that it is organizationally/culturally not equipped to grow organically and now seems willing to acquire for growth.","Weak Strategic Thinking
""Evolving"" strategy as each year's strategy proved to not work. Each year's strategy is based on models of the industry where either the model is unconvincing or it is not at all clear why Dropbox's approach is the winning one.

Passive Aggressive Culture
People are always friendly face to face but beneath the veneer there is a lot of jockeying for power. Power distribution is evident when prizes projects get done by in power teams even though the area is theoretically another team's area of responsibility. People assign overflow tasks to other people even though they are responsible for it. People initially promise to do work and then shirk it without repercussions.

Politics
Ultimately unsuccessful projects were created and pushed out the door to get people promoted. Many people jump on board early on and generate immediately ridiculous shoddy user research to back up the work. Shallow technology is hyped as awesome and weak initial indicators are seen as good. Many of the promoted people still remain or get promoted even further up to do more damage.

Promotions are based on getting backing from managers and hopping on board initiatives that staff engineers or managers push. Each new set of staff engineers or managers disparages the work of the previous set and advocates for their own work. No one is willing to push back against what they say.

Levels are uneven with some staff or senior engineers/QA who are anything but that. Long time mediocre people are accumulating. Some title inflation for new hires.

-Work/life balance

-Benefits
-There are a lot of chances for ownership and a ton of work still to be done.

-The people are great. Dropbox is incredible at finding a diverse range of high quality people.

-Diversity.

-The company culture is very inclusive.

-Still has the feel of a much smaller company.","People are churning out very fast in the past 9-12mo.

-Busy work is rewarded. A lot of people put out a ton of ""work"", but very little has impact. The volume of work is often used by people to vouch for promotion, bonuses, or transfer to higher roles in other teams.

-Reorgs. The company has had 6 internal re-orgs on teams I have been on since I joined. Imagine working on a project for 6 months, getting everything in line and then leadership decides to do something completely different. This makes it super hard for many people to actually accomplish something start to finish.

-A lot of teams are made up mostly by people who come in through the Dropbox Rotation Program out of school. I find that these teams are highly tribal, not open to criticism, and often do not do very high quality work but know how to play the system very well.

-Peer review process is hit or miss and a lot is open to what feedback your managers choose to include. Moreover if you move to another team you can often be ""re-leveled"" and miss out on promotions or career path opportunities.

-Due to there being so much work to be in certain divisions, a lot of time is wasted on things that have minor impact. On one hand employees milk this because it makes them look like they do a ton of informative work, but on the other hand if you look at things from the big picture we learn slowly and can't scale ideas well.","Stop reorganizing divisions every few months.

-Invest more in data quality and analytics..

-Stop letting relatively inexperienced or junior staff interview technical candidates with more experience. You miss out on so many amazing candidates because the interviewer is simply not on the candidate's skill or communication level.

-Tuck Shop is cool, but you should trend towards serving healthier options. It becomes patronizing after the initial awe wears off.",2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

Tue Aug 07 2018 18:19:05 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Product Designer,,Current Employee ,"Well-Intentioned, Disorganized, Directionless",I have been working at Dropbox full-time for more than a year,51,"Benefits and pay are truly excellent. There are generous stipends for transit, wellness, learning and development (books and conferences), and others. Dental, vision, and health are all covered. There is donation matching up to a $1000 per year, unlimited volunteer and paid time off (which, if you're daring enough to request, truly seems unlimited—I have yet to hear of someone's PTO request being declined), and if you're in an office with a Tuck Shop, world-class food served every day. You can gift Dropbox space to friends and family.

The culture values kindness and open-mindedness to a fault, and teams are given massive autonomy to work and ship as they see fit. This means you can have very different experiences depending on your team and manager. This also means if you see something broken, you're generally given the OK to go and fix it if you have the will.

There are company events throughout the year, including team offsites (I've been hiking, on a cruise, to an escape room, and to countless dinners and happy hours), guest speakers, parties, etc. Dropbox seems to spare no expense on events and travel, although I've heard it was even more extravagant in the past.","Dropbox lies squarely in the ""ruinous empathy"" quadrant of business culture. Promotions are measured by the number of friends you make, not the results you achieve, which results in decision making by committee and projects that lag on for months at a time because nobody is willing to take ownership or say ""no."" At the same time, projects spanning 6+ months of research, design, and engineering can be derailed by the opinion of a single manager in the pursuit of ""perfect"" rather than ""better"".

Staff lack a clear vision for Dropbox. Milquetoast strategy updates and new opportunities receive endless bravado but when it comes to actual execution there's little follow-through. Meanwhile, the core Dropbox product continues to suffer from longstanding problems like convoluted sharing and horrendously slow performance.

We use Dropbox Paper, our own docs offering, for absolutely everything—from project management to calendaring to to-do lists to meeting notes. What results is total chaos. There is no sane way to organize docs, which get produced at an astounding rate: product managers regularly compose dozens of new Paper docs in any given week. There is no way we would organize ourselves this way if we weren't so committed to using and abusing our own tool.

Simple bugfixes languish in backlogs for months or years without resolution. Abysmal developer tools and nonexistent analytics slow the company to a crawl. 

We talk a big talk about ""designing a more enlightened way of working"" (corporate thinkpieces go up on the blog every few weeks) but how can we hope to improve work for others when our own house is a mess?

All these issues aren't new, and they're well-known to anyone who has been in the organization for longer than a year. We will talk about them and collectively agree they need to be addressed, but for whatever reason, nothing ever seems to happen.","LEAD. Where are you? From down on the ground, seems like you've tapped out. Commit to a direction and see it through. Hold people accountable for results and set real deadlines. Fix the basics.

Standardize from the top down. We aren't a startup anymore, but we still act like one. We need standard platforms and processes across the org for project management, hard requirements for shipping, easily accessible analytics for *all* teams, and a continuous, direct line of communication with customer success so we understand the real problems that users are facing, not the problems we make up for our user personas to face.

Treat remote offices as first-class citizens. There's a lot of thrash that most likely goes unnoticed in SF. Check in to see how people are doing.

- We're working on interesting problems and thinking critically and empathetically about how to improve the way people get work done

- If you care about work/life balance, you can definitely find it here."," There's a lot of fear internally about breaking pieces of our business model or product or website that have traditionally worked well for the company, which stifles our own ability to take risks and innovate. 

- People are almost too nice, which had led to a culture where you need to get everyone's buy in before your project can move forward.

What you’re left with is the freedom and time to do the work you’re meant to do.

After having worked at several large tech companies in the area, I have realistic expectations when it comes to culture and work environment and often after seeing behind the curtains am disappointed with the results, however here I haven't seen anything that is popping that bubble. Even though we work in a satellite office (the HQ is in San Francisco) they are very careful to ensure that we maintain that environment that makes Dropbox special, as well as including everyone and being very transparent so that we don't end up feeling like a lonely island. 
*Benefits here are amazing (even compared with Microsoft, Facebook and the like)
*Perks include having a catered breakfast, lunch & dinner (if you are going to be working past 5) every day.

We also have a lounge area complete with Xbox One & Sega (old school), full band set-up, pool table, foosball, ping pong table and lots of different working spaces for any kind of work environment requested. 
*Company founders are onsite and super accessible, they really do care about each and every employee and put a lot into everything.

The transparency here is amazing, and if you have an idea or want to try something new out, I've been met with ""yes"" every time.

This is a great place to start your career if you're entry-level.","All that glitters isn't gold. Despite the glitz of the perks, many people at Dropbox are really unhappy. This is due to several things:
- Bad managers. Like, really bad. Very little training offered to new managers, and the company does not take action on managers who are consistently rated poorly or who have a lot of turnover on their team.
- Very little career development. If you're mid-to-senior level and you're looking for autonomy and responsibility, this is likely not the place for you.
- Dropbox is NOT a meritocracy. Many leveling and compensation decisions are based on favorites and are inconsistent from team to team, or level to level.
- Despite being a relatively small company, it's tough to get things done. Weighed down by red tape and bureaucracy. If you're someone who is execution-oriented and likes to move fast, look elsewhere.","Stick to the values and raise the hiring bar. Stop hiring and promoting bad managers.

Internally the culture and practices have really matured as well. Lots of investment in engineering tools and people development that didn't exist before. 3 years ago Dropbox was much less formal about this and it meant that if you were passive you might not get the feedback/opportunities you need to grow. These days that's fixed with the company investing lots in building up its people and helping them to find the right opportunities that fit them.

I'm still very optimistic about the business. Dropbox's renewed focus on enterprise (while still supporting a best-in-class consumer product) is unlocking a huge revenue stream and the team is laser focused on building it right. Given recent revenue, the 10B valuation seems pretty fair."," still some growing pains, but overall the company has become much more mature!

And they're doing it in an audacious way: make something people want, charge them for it, and sell it to millions of people. There's no ""capture a fraction of the transaction cost"" or ""throw ads at people to extract value from something they'd like to get for free"" here. It's a very clear, ""make something people want enough that they'll pay you for it"" business model. And as a maker, that's an exciting place to be.

The level of vertical integration (buy electricity, server components, and dark fiber/sell to mom and pop consumers) is the kind of thing you only expect to see from the phone company, or maybe Google or Amazon. Certainly not from a company with a couple hundred engineers. On a day-to-day basis, that means that the impact any particular engineer can have is HIGH.

The overall philosophy at Dropbox seems to be, ""hire the best people you can find, and give them the freedom to do their thing."" On the engineering side, this means the team is friendly, smart, and eager to help each other, making it a great place to learn.

That same philosophy applies outside of engineering, as well. Take the tuck shop (cafe), for example: Chef Brian and Chef Danny have hired great talent and given them the latitude to be creative, and as a result Dropbox has the best company food I've come across. My friends at Google love coming to Dropbox for lunch because the food is such a treat.","Dropbox is making the transition from a startup to a real company. And that means having the downsides of both a startup and a real company.

The real company downsides are pretty familiar: there's not as much openness as at a small company, you can get stuck with a lousy manager or on a project that gets canned, there's things you can't know and hoops you have to jump through for confidentiality/strategy/compliance reasons, etc.

The small company downsides are also real: your stock is monopoly money, there's a lot of uncertainty, and if you get stuck with a lousy manager, there might not be the systems in place to deal with it.

My biggest concern personally is that leveling and career progression seems fairly haphazard. Reviews have happened about twice a year since 2014, and every single review cycle has used a different set of criteria. And they're developing a new one for this fall's reviews. On some level, the things that make you a good engineer are universal across evaluation frameworks, but on another (e.g. does the system emphasize how well you facilitate other teams' work or how well your team executes its own tasks) it can make a pretty substantial difference.","The current management framework puts managers in a position of having to choose between company values and their team's OKR's. Different managers will err in different directions when it comes to that tension. Consider how values and OKR's map to each other.

-Prior to joining, I thought the team was much larger and much further along than it is and as a result there's a lot left to do as we scale and grow. You get the luxury of an already well known brand but the infrastructure of a small to mid-size company with a lot of things to still tackle!

And unfortunately those layers are overly controlling. Managers do not control their teams or pretty much any decisions within their teams, from hiring, structure, communications, even strategy or logistics. The main function of manages becomes to run meeting logistics, be a point person for recruiting, and taking the heat for any problems.

Most folks in the company are very young, including most leadership, and do not have the perspective to understand that this is not typical and does not allow leadership to thrive or develop. There is much hand-wringing about how to develop good leadership, training programs being rolled out, etc. But I'm afraid that without working on reducing the culture of micromanagement that has developed, they're focusing on the wrong things to cultivate strong and experienced leadership, much less retention of those leaders.","Let your managers do what they're good at.

- Solid medical benefits and meals
- Gym & shower in the building"," Leadership lacking at every level; minimal mentorship or coaching, leads care about how you help them to their number, but not about you as a person
- Unclear career path, especially in satellite offices; dozens of people have left for other offices with better opportunities
- Bro culture on the sales side with a local ""leader"" who is unable to relate to anyone not exactly like him
- Because of the above point, attempts at diversity are feeble and just for show 
- No transparency as to how sales quotas are determined; they seem to be picked from the sky

Unfortunately, there aren't many of them left in the office... 
- The perks are great. It's nice to not have to worry about food, and the health benefits are better than in most companies I've seen. 
- The office location is in the heart of downtown and the building has a great rooftop deck and gym in the basement."," For enterprise sales, you are promised high multipliers coming into the company, while less than 10% of the AEs on the enterprise team made their quota in 2015, so very few people ever reach these supposed numbers and most end up making less than they did before they came to Dropbox. The MM reps have the same quota whether their territory is NYC or Kansas (they consider a knowledge worker in one state equivalent to another) so quota achievement in that group is almost entirely based on whether you get a good territory. 
- The senior sales management in Austin is the worst I have ever worked with in my career. Countless sales females who were working in Austin have left the company, moved to other offices, or switched teams to get away from it. To date, there are no female sales managers in Austin and any female who could have been promoted, but who has disagreed with them, has been run off, leaving only newly hired people to choose from. 
- Inexperienced people in the company are given authority and power to do things they should not be allowed to do, i.e. the territories for the entire sales team were cut by someone 1-2 years out of school with no background in finance or consulting. 
- There is a clear lack of communication and coordination between teams in and around sales, which leads to a lot of confusion and course correction from week to week. It's hard to focus on selling when you have to keep track of so many things outside sales that affect your day to day. 
- The focus from the company is on the ""wedding not the marriage"" when it comes to sales. They do everything to help bring you in the door, but once there, there is little done towards retaining top talent which has led to an exodus of some of the best sales reps over the past months. 

Overall, know what you're getting into when joining Dropbox. There are still good people here and if you can find a good manager, you can create an enjoyable work environment. Unfortunately, with the senior sales management currently in Austin, I would recommend the other offices over this one, especially as a female.",,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

- If you're looking for a small, scrappy start up, we're not longer that. Processes are harder than ever to get through - people aren't on the same page (including the people who should be running them). There are layers upon layers of management and approvals needed that things sometimes take weeks to turnaround.

- We care more about what we are perceived to the outside world than valuing our employees. We work so hard to recruit talent but don't carve out paths or reward systems for them once they join. 

- Line and mid level managers are very junior IE this is the first management experience they have, and the training they receive leaves you with a hammer and no nails. On top of this, some of the best engineers are asked to move in to management when they don't desire to be, which really doesn't help anyone. 

- A lot of the company is built on referrals, which really doesn't help with diversity (of social, economic, or thought). People who think differently aren't encouraged to continue the conversation.

* Very high growth, fast moving so decisions can seem hasty or unthoughtful at times
* Not a good place for someone who wants the start up experience - we are too big now and layers are being added into the fold; (a pro because we need more delegation and need to make sure we don't have too many people trying to boil the ocean, but a con if you want a ton of autonomy and a big stake in multiple projects)","Work on cash pay....we are seeing more and more regretable attrition amongst top talent whom probably felt no other choice but to leave for the $$$ offers out there, even if at heart, they preferred to stay at Dropbox

There is ownership in the work and it's easy to feel bought into what the company is trying to accomplish. There is a strong sense of community outside of work. The culture promotes continuous learning and provides the resources to do so; for instance, if someone wanted to learn how to code, play a new instrument, or learn a new language, it's very easy to do so at work. There is an interest group for pretty much anything you can think of, from soccer to poker to smash bros to Taylor Swift, which makes it easy to meet others and keep hobbies active.
- The talent bar has managed to stay incredibly high despite the increase in company size. There is probably no other group of 1,000+ individuals working on the same product as smart and talented as the team at Dropbox. Even though everyone is insanely smart and accomplished, people are unbelievably down to earth, approachable, and nice. In a recent internal survey of what it meant to be 'Dropboxy', humble was the most cited response by far.
- Have personally not had issues with work / life balance, but some individuals have probably had unfortunate experiences. I feel the company provides enough ownership and responsibility that one has control over work schedule and cadence, leading to much more predictability in hours. Even if I have a lot of work, I can still make plans on any day of the week, honor them, and finish up afterward from home if necessary. Increased ownership also means I'm directing my work more, so I don't find myself re-doing work unnecessarily. Only times I've worked longer hours are because I've wanted to do so on my own accord.
- Business is strong. A lot of external criticism regarding valuation and how well the business is actually doing, but company is on a growth trajectory most companies wish they could ever experience. Senior executive bench is stacked (COO, CFO, VPs); Dropbox has managed to bring in incredibly impressive individuals who've accomplished a lot at other companies.
- Compensation and perks are benchmarked to be among the top in the valley. Food is definitely the best in the valley, and probably of any corporate environment in the world."," Regarding point above on business being strong, Dropbox cannot say it has won. Cloud storage / collaboration space is very competitive with giants like Microsoft and Google wanting a piece. Company appears to lack a sense of urgency given success to date, but needs to keep pushing forward to sustain growth.
- To maintain extremely positive culture, a sub-culture of conflict aversion seems to have developed. Leads to some group think.
- Related to above, company has a hard time with having difficult conversations and making difficult decisions. More prevalent in inexperienced decision makers who want every piece of information and unanimous decision making, instead of just making a call.

-I won't speak much about this. If you're considering Dropbox, you're probably also considering Google, Facebook, Twitter, AirBnB, Pinterest, etc... Good people at the top startups are a given these days.

Opportunity to Land Grab
- If you're positive, you call it opportunity. If you're a cynic, you call it a Land Grab. The result is the same.

Tue Feb 10 2015 15:01:18 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time),,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Problematic company culture,I worked at Dropbox full-time,55,More than generous compensation and perks.,"Everyone at Dropbox spends a lot of time telling themselves and each other how great it is to work there, and not enough time making it a great place to work.

- Whenever Dropbox makes a public announcement, employees are encouraged to the point of cajoled into leaving positive comments and favorable reviews on public forums with personal accounts (""Don't forget to upvote the announcement on Hackernews! But don't do it on the office wifi because that can trigger a spam alert..."", etc).
- Troubling company value: We not I. This means that you should put Dropbox before your own personal wellbeing. Employees that make personal sacrifices for the benefit of the company are deified at the all hands meeting.
- Cross-functional communication or collaboration is effectively impossible without the involvement of a manager or three, as everyone is worried only about completing their own sprint goals. The ""start-up mindset"" is useless for a 1000+ person corporate entity.
- Interviews and hire decisions are conducted in a very haphazard and non-transparent way, with more than a few interviewees mysteriously turned away after a consensus ""hire"" decision. 
- If you're not a 22 year old, male, Stanford/MIT/Carnegie Mellon grad or a Facebook/Google alumn, prepare to feel very out of place and marginalized.
- Good work goes unacknowledged unless you are a relentless self-promoter or part of the in-crowd. With respect to code, quantity counts more than quality.
- Working hours regularly extend late into the night. I once tried to hold a 10:30 am meeting, and was told by a manager that this was ""ridiculously early"". Another time, I came into the office around 11 PM to pick up something that I had forgotten, and it was half full with people working and playing video games.
- Consequently, important business decisions get made during non-standard business hours, so when you come into work at 9 AM, you'll be greeted with an inbox full of new decisions, priorities and tasks.
- Heavy drinking is commonplace at most official and non-official company functions, and opting-out is seen as being ""not part of the team"". When many of your coworkers/managers end up at a bachelor party in Vegas, you will definitely hear about it at your next sprint planning meeting.
- Gossip-y. Again, if you're not in the in-crowed, you will be at its mercy.
-- This extends to HR. Do not share anything with HR that you don't want your manager and coworkers to also know.
- Rampant entitlement among employees. At dinner, one can frequently overhear such gems as ""I'm too good for MUNI"" and ""Well it's easier for women to get hired, so that's probably why she was hired and not X (male person)"".

Summarily, I felt that my career prospects would be limited as I was not part of the in-crowd, and unwilling to put in 60 hour weeks among less-than-desirable company. Ultimately though, Dropbox will continue to make buckets of money despite its troubling culture.",,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0

People have a lot of freedom to choose which projects they work on and how they work on them. And that culture extends throughout the company.

The perks and benefits are good, and people use them. Free food is the norm in tech these days, but what Tuck Shop turns out is unlike anything I've seen at any other company. Actually, that doesn't do it justice. The Tuck Shop turns out food that can go toe-to-toe with any trendy SF restaurant you can name. Or you can always get a sandwich, a burger, pizza, or salad, if you're of the less adventurous type (but what's the fun in that?)

There's also a slew of other benefits: health/vision/dental, 401k match, donation match, commuter benefit, cell phone, gym (both on-site w/ free laundry and a $100/month subsidy for an outside gym), basically, you name it, Dropbox has it.

The culture embraces the fact that people work better when they have breaks, so people actually use their vacation days. And people work pretty flexible hours.","The pace of growth brings some problems. For one thing, everyone has to spend a lot of time interviewing potential new Dropboxers. For another, growth means every week there are more desks and fewer marginal spaces (e.g. couches) until we get more office space, and the people you're sitting next to today are unlikely to be the people you're sitting next to two months from now.

Also, to make the freedom work, there are a lot of meetings.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The level of technical talent here is better than pretty much any other company (and Dropbox maintains a high hiring bar to make sure that it doesn't drop). This provides a lot of opportunity for learning and means that I can fully trust my coworkers to produce excellent work. I also get a lot of control over what I work on and how it should be implemented. My manager/PM are always open to suggestions on how things should work from the technical to the product level, and I don't usually have to go through them anyway. Work/life balance is great. I don't work weekends at all and I have yet to go above 50 hours a week (not including meals at the office). Compensation is on par or better than any other company in SV and the perks are great (best food of any tech company!).","The company is still growing very quickly which means that a lot of the processes aren't as set in stone as they are at larger/more stable companies. This means that when trying to do certain things, no one really has a good idea of how to go about it (e.g. compensation reviews were only standardized relatively recently).

For most, the constant obsession with improving the product and our internal procedures is probably the biggest draw. If you have a good idea, MGMT is very receptive to criticism of the status quo, and moves quickly to improve. Sense of ownership over work. 
-People: Biggest perk is the people -- really enjoy spending time with my colleagues. Very familial. I am in a satellite office (Austin) so I don't know if this is the same as in SF, but it is very closely knit here. Also - I'm gay, and it has never come up as an issue (not that I am very surprised, but it is worth noting). We have a very supportive queer community in the office, going to LGBT events in town, etc. I rarely feel like an outsider, even though most of the office is straight. 
-Work-life: Although my colleagues are all very hard workers, they also have a lot going on outside of work. One has a top-rated EE Cummings poetry blog, another is working on releasing a rock EP, or is playing a show at a bar down the road, or is doing standup comedy, or inviting people to go volunteer at a local school, or go to an art show etc etc... everyone has an interesting life outside of work, and really cares about engaging with Austin. I think that is rare in a lot of organizations, where the conveniences offered by an office, and the drive to succeed, isolate employees from forming roots where they life. 
-Hiring: I have done some interviewing for prospective candidates, and the training is very value-oriented. I think we attract top talent, sure, but if the person doesn't contribute in some way, or bring a diverse viewpoint into the organization, then the talents will not meant as much. Good balance of finding good workers + human beings. Makes me comfortable to know that, as we grow, the org will still be filled with people you care about, outside of work relationships. 
-Transparency: management is super, super open. This might change as we grow, but they work hard to keep everyone in the loop.","The rate of change here is very fast -- which is great in many ways (rarely boring, easy to address flaws, etc) and is something I was attracted to at first. However, it is a bit hard to imagine what my career will look like a year out. Again, the unknowing is part of the charm, but can be a bit frustrating when you are trying to plan for the future.

This allows me to have a work-life balance, and it allows me to cater to my kids' needs whenever I need to.

Mon May 19 2014 08:20:18 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Account Executive (Sales),"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Doesn't get much better than this -,I have been working at Dropbox full-time for less than a year,4,"Dropbox is truly one-of-a-kind place. When I was looking at tech companies, I was fortunate enough to be considered at places like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Frankly, I didn't really seriously consider Dropbox until I received a call from a recruiter who had received my resume, and wanted to set up a phone screen. Wow - was I missing out on the best place to work in the valley right now. Upon receiving an offer here, there was zero question or doubt in my mind about accepting - Google could have come back with all the compensation in the world, but the opportunity to help build the next big thing at Dropbox was unparalleled. Here are a few of the reasons I decided to join, and love working here:
- There's no bureacracy at this place. Sure, we are still small-ish (about 700 now, about 500 when I started), but things just get DONE. There isn't a lot of 'approval' and 'review' for little changes that need to be made or for ideas that folks want to give a whirl. Such a refreshing process.
- The leadership team is phenomenal. There is no hiding behind walls (literally - even our co-founders sit in our open-space desk arrangement amongst everyone else) and they are available and accessible. Exec. team is super grounded and humble, and this allows us to grow in a healthy way, because egos don't get you anywhere here.
- The opportunity that is available is the KEY to joining this place. If you are willing to work super hard and get your hands dirty, you will be able to join products, drive initiatives, and actually get stuff done. Your work doesn't feel menial -it feels like you are actually helping to grow this place.
- The PERKS are just as fabulous (if not more) than any other hot tech company. Why? Because we are still growing, so the perks feel super customized and high touch. There is plenty of pitching myself here because I wonder how I landed this gig. It's a dream."," It's honestly so fun and social that I sometimes worry about my non-Dropbox life and if I am giving it enough attention. By all means, it is my decision to stay for dinner, happy hours, and other social activities, and there is no pressure to do these things, but they have created such a great environment here that it is easy to get roped in and abandon other parts of your life. Disclaimer: Dropbox is NOT a place that does not support work/life balance. Everyone gets to choose how involved they become!
- Some growing pains. As we hire like crazy this year, we will (and are) experiencing slight growing pains like having the company split into different buildings (they are a 5 minute walk apart, but still changes the dynamic). Inevitable, though, at a company that is succeeding.","Keep doing what you are doing, and don't sell out to politics as we grow! Also, as we continue the push to make Dropbox an exceptionally diverse place to work, let's not forget this initiative and embed this in to our company values long-term.",5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

One of the biggest benefits i've experienced has been the people - you truly get to work with insanely smart, talented people who are genuinely fun to work with - and this is the result of an intense hiring process that screens out a lot of great candidates. Office perks in SF are fantastic (particularly the world class food) and they're getting better at the remote offices. (Side note about remote offices - they are treated with the same level of importance as the SF office, we get tons of visitors, and people in SF make a point of keeping us informed about what's going on.) Compensation is generally in line with similar positions in the market, depending on role. The company is growing quickly (but responsibly), so there is ample opportunity to grow as new teams are being formed regularly.","The San Francisco office is a bit crowded right now due to rapid growth and the open seating plan; this can make it difficult (but not impossible) to focus on work. Although decisions at the founder level are very transparent to the whole company, some teams don't enjoy the same level of transparency from middle-management.

The decision making process at the exec level is really transparent, so you get to learn a lot on a broader company level (what our 3/6/12 month goals are, why they are that way, what we could of done better in the last year, etc.). There are times when I feel like part of my job is getting paid to go to business school, how awesome is that?

There are a lot of great people here to help teach you ""stuff"". (Sorry for the engineers reading this part, I'll let our eng gals and guys speak more to that sphere). You want to learn Photoshop? SQL, Hive, Python, how our infrastructure works? It is nice to know that you can never stop learning. 

Especially for those of us early in their career, a culture of learning and getting connected with the right people and teams is crucial. It is also nice to know that it is at a company that is not yet 3, 5, 10, or 30 thousand people... Lots of opportunities, lots of growth ahead, easier to navigate and learn from different parts of the business, etc. Not trying to say big corporations don't have great opportunities, just that they have different ones.

I could go on and on about perks. But I won't. Besides the Tuck Shop... their food is legendary. Also, +1 to the kickass office space... and the kickass office team! 

What else? Truthfully, some of my closest friends in San Francisco are dropboxers, in and outside of the office. It's also important to note that many of my professional mentors and leaders that I look up to are also here. It's nice to have that spectrum of choice :)

My leads (""managers"") have all exposed me to different expertise and ways of thinking. I've reported to a cofounder of a startup we've acquired, a military vet with an MBA, a consultant that worked in London and Russia, and a former professional Drummer that played on stage at Lollapalooza.

I learn from sales people, I learn from engineers, I learn from designers, I learn from our COO, our CFO, our cofounders, and just about every other single person at this company. I wake up relatively stoked to come in to the office and feel satisfied enough to leave at a reasonable hour. I take vacations. Sometimes I leave at 4pm, sometimes 5 or 6, sometimes 9. I enjoy my weekends. I have built solid skills set entirely at work. I don't drink the Koolaid, it is just really hard not to be happy here when you work with fun, smart, and friendly people.

One of the best pieces of advice I received growing up was ""surround yourself with people that are smarter than you"". We have leaders in design, engineering, and business. My teammates and friends at Dropboxer never cease to impress me. Sometimes, I wish it was me that felt like Einstein, but for now I am completely content with feeling like Curious George. The efforts and outputs of my peers both push me and remind me that there is plenty more to learn, and PLENTY more to do.","Structure and career pathing isn't *yet* as defined as it would be at a Google or Facebook.

 - Working at a company that produces a product that so many people know, and appreciate is really rewarding.
 - Rapid growth means that a lot of new opportunities emerge, no matter the role you join"," People here work really hard. Almost nobody is working a set 9-5 day unless they put their own boundaries around work because of other very important commitments.
 - You have to remain flexible. Depending on the situation, the role you're recruited for may be different that the role that's needed a couple weeks or months in.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

Everyone I work with is extremely smart, capable and driven. Ownership comes with the territory, yet people don't get in the way of execution. Dropbox treats employees well and really provides a sense of meaningful work life/balance. It also doesn't hurt that the benefits are great and the food is amazing.","Some lack of organizational structure makes it hard to understand who does what. That being said, this hasn't interfered with getting things done because everyone tends to ""own it"". The company is now grown to a size where we have different areas for different employees (ie 2 levels in China Basin) which makes it hard to get to know people that are in different areas.",Never lose sight of building an everlasting culture.

Wed May 28 2014 09:53:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Recruiting Coordinator,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,I love the company culture; you can sit down with anyone and have an amazing conversation.,I have been working at Dropbox full-time for less than a year,,"Dropbox encourages people to pursue their passions, both within and outside of their core job responsibilities. For example, there is a music room in the office, so people who love playing music can jam. There is a gym, so people who love lifting weights or doing yoga can do that. Often times, the amazing amenities get incorporate into peoples' job functions; for example, I am a recruiter, and often I use music to connect with candidates and help share the joy of the office.","I think the biggest challenge is work/life balance. Because the office is a fun place to be, sometimes folks have a hard time leaving. I think it would actually help Dropbox if the work culture was slightly less insular. 

Also, being a fast-growing but still relatively small company, often times there is less structure within job functions; this can be a pro or a con, depending on what you're looking for in your career.","Sometimes work allocation is fairly uneven; there should be more clear ways to distribute work, and validate and reward those who put in extra effort.",4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

- can sometimes work remotely depending on your role"," It's unfortunate that the company changes so fast that your job description may change between when you sign your contract and start working. Makes us look bad for new hires.
