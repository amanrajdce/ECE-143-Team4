Sat Nov 09 2019 18:15:55 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Senior Software Engineer,"Eagle, ID",Current Employee ,Boise Site (TSheets) - Great place to be,I have been working at Intuit full-time for more than 3 years,,"I was here before the acquisition and got to see the company change from a little Eagle ID startup to part of an 8,000+ employee corporation. Here are some thoughts from a software dev's perspective:

- The benefits got a lot better, you probably won't find any other jobs in Boise area that beat the benefits at Intuit. (Insurance, stock, bonus, etc,.)
- People you work with on a day to day are very smart.
- Intuit has some cool tech they're promoting internally for use across products.
- You get personal dev days at the end of each sprint and engineering days twice a year, which you can use to work on basically whatever you want, as long as you're improving yourself or the company in some way. (personal dev I usually spend learning new technologies I'm interested in by working on fun side projects.) If it weren't for personal dev I would've left the company years ago, it gives devs the ability to hone new skills instead of staying in their bubble."," TSheets lacks someone in the architect role so different development projects don't always come together nicely. Other intuit orgs have architect(s) who take on the job of forming a broader vision of how the codebase / architecture should work. 
 Seems like devs are always writing a lot of hacky stuff to make things work because of a lack of someone who has a bigger vision.
- Codebase will leave you wanting. I guess with a 12+ year old php monolith what are you going to do.. I will say it's getting better though.
- Management could prioritize code improvements more. Our feature teams don't have as high velocity as they could because of handicaps in our codebase.","Put someone in the architect role. Make that someone's full time job, it's seriously needed.

A while back there was talk about ""development sprints"".. or whatever we were calling it - a special sprint several times a year where devs could focus on cleaning up unused code, useful refactors, etc,. rather than feature work. That was talked about by the top dog JD at sprint retro and sounded official, then sort of never got spoken of again. From talking to devs around the org, those would seriously be useful even if it's just some teams here and there so please think about doing that.",4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

They provide amazing benefits and try to ensure the benefits are molded to the employee wants and needs. I have a positive work environment and still enjoy coming to work everyday because it has great people and the work I do makes me feel like I've made an impact so it's rewarding.,"It seems in the last year or so Intuit has been utilizing outsourcing agencies for our customer care. Although the intention is to provide jobs in areas that are struggling economically, it has hindered the amazing service we once provided and has caused a divide between Intuit agents and outsourced agents. These outsourced agents are not given the benefits and care that Intuit agents are given so they're not going to provide the amazing care that a happy employee would.

Internal jobs or career growth is not quite what it was. When I first started, Intuit was all about internal career opportunities and now it seems they look more externally. Career moves are not quite what they used to be. If a position is considered an entry level position then Intuit shouldn't be looking for someone who is more qualified. More opportunity should be given to agents that have dedicated their time to the business first rather than seeking externally.","Bring our care back in-house because happy employees means happy customers and in the long run that's more revenue for Intuit. Or work with the outsourced agencies to make sure our values are truly aligned and make sure their employees are truly happy. This is not insight that will be given right away, these outsourced agents need to feel like they can trust our people are there for them.

-Take care of your current employee's career growth before hiring outside. Entry level should be entry level. An 'Entry Level' Accountant position shouldn't have a ""preferred"" of a CPA certification. To become a CPA you have to have hands on experience under a CPA first. Bypassing employees that do not have this certification makes the job posting misleading and discouraging for future roles that may open up. CPA preferred shouldn't be on anything that is listed as entry level for a standard Accountant role.",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0

First, the way they regard their employees is amazing. Having been in a sales role in several industries over my career, I have never seen a company so humble and interested in their employees. They genuinely care that you not only succeed, but work towards a goal that will make you happy.

Second, I know it’s cheesy but they let you be you. You are not molded into the model that they want in their company. They let you bring your strengths and your passions into work and direct you to use those for the good of company. 

They love innovation. I have had the opportunity within my first year to question processes and long held practices. With the support of my manager and director, I was supported the whole time. Never once was I made to feel that I should get in line, like many other companies. My ideas were judged on their merits and they welcomed the disruption to their practices. 

Finally, the benefits and opportunities to help your community are amazing. I have zero worries that whatever life throws at my family, Intuit will be standing behind me the entire time with all their resources. 

The list really does go on and on, but if it sounds too good to be true, it isn’t at Intuit.",The workload is A LOT. The company is constantly innovating.

It's easy to relate to our customers because we're all consumers with money concerns. We also cater to small businesses and the self-employed (a growing market because of the gig economy). Small businesses are the backbone of the economy, and I'm proud that although I work for a 9,000-person corporation, our focus is on the little guy. I never feel like I'm ""working for the man."" In fact, there's a larger than average number of women in leadership positions here. And we have a thriving program called ""Tech Women @ Intuit,"" with a team of four full-time employees who ensure that we attract, retain and promote technical women. Because of this and our family-friendly benefits and culture, I think Intuit is a top choice for technical women.

Another part of Intuit that resonates me is our ""We Care & Give Back"" program, which has shaped my approach to charitable giving. The company matches up to $5,000/year of employee donations, so my giving has double the impact. On top of that, Intuit pays for the annual gift I need to make because I sit on the board of a nonprofit. All employees get 32 hours of paid time to do charitable work. And what's most exciting is that the company has started creating ""Prosperity Hubs"" in economically struggling parts of the U.S., like in W. Virginia, where we train hundreds of people and give them jobs in the tech industry -- breaking their dependency on environmentally disastrous and dying industries like coal.

Lastly, the company recognizes the good work I do and pays me well. Over the years, my salary has paid for my daughter's college tuition (she has no student loan debt) and her wedding. I like the work I do, I've improved the lives of our employees, our customers and those in need, I've met great people and have made some lifelong friends, and my financial needs are covered.

Some bullet points are: Great benefits, invested in improving their employees, company culture isn't an afterthought. They're also actively working to bring modern tools and technology into the development stack allowing us to do some pretty cools things","Sadly while the culture is great, and the public facing technology is what you would expect from a modern SaaS company, the immediate tools they allow you to work with are not. It's fairly obvious the their IT organisation is pretty old school. While offering both Macs and PC's, the PC's are behemoths and not fun to carry around. They're so loaded with security software trying compensate for Window's poor security that you're lucky if the batteries last an hour sometimes. Sadly the Mac's aren't much better. Using a modern Linux distro isn't even allowed so you're stuck with 2 poor options for development environments. I often feel like the policies and infrastructure their IT org has put in place is actively trying to prevent me from getting my work done. 

Oh, I almost forgot to mention they've also installed keyloggers on their laptops. Nothing says you don't quite trust your employees like key loggers, ehh?","Intuit does everything else so well. It may seem small but I spend my entire day working on my laptop. These IT policies are put in place in a vacuum with no input from the people they are impacting day to day.

Sun Apr 07 2019 08:00:27 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,Good company...but. Lack of Career Growth - Very Hierarchical - Excessive Micromanagement,I have been working at Intuit full-time,13,"Good benefits. Cutting edge - Innovative culture. Not satisfied with the status-quo but constantly striving to get better and better. They do walk the talk - “Integrity without Compromise”. Talented, driven people.","Internal opportunities are stagnant. In the years I have been with this company, I have seen time and time again where leadership would rather hire from outside the company than develop or cultivate development opportunities for internal employees. Because of this consistent behavior, upward mobility is very scarce within this company. To be certain, sometimes you need to bring in external talent to move things forward and address gaps, however, you also need to set your current employees up for success with targeted opportunities for development and a career path. The scale is tipped much further to the external hiring side at this company. Promotions to a director position are as rare as a Bigfoot sighting. You would have a better chance to get ahead (statistically) at this company by leaving, landing a higher position at a different company, and then trying to get hired back at Intuit at that same acquired level or higher. Seriously, if you do get hired here, plan to stay right where you are for a long, long time.

A very hierarchical culture by comparison to other companies I have worked for. Way too many hierarchical “roadblocks”. It seems childish (and it really is), but team managers and directors do not exactly like or encourage managers to communicate directly with executives if they are not involved directly with the communication. They want to be seen and heard when execs are involved. Very common for emails or presentations to be scrutinized many, many times over before being “allowed” to be sent or presented. Slows the communication process WAY down and creates a lot of extra work just to get communications out. No…this is not just “coaching” employees on effective executive communication. This behavior is prevalent and falls way outside of simple “coaching”. It’s sad, but the behavior shows a real lack of trust and results in a lot of wasted time due to excessive, un-needed micromanaging. I think if the executives could track the amount of time and effort that gets expended just to get communications to them from the “troops” they would immediately put a stop to this “roadblocking” behavior. It is no exaggeration to say that this bureaucratic back and forth consumes hours out of mine and my colleagues work week on a very regular basis. 

No doubt about it…Intuit goes through a very careful and extensive process to recruit and hire just the right candidates. They thoroughly vet candidates and form ""Assess for Awesome"" teams to ensure all candidates are very carefully reviewed and then selected. They pour a lot of time and effort into this process and then turn right around and micromanage the hell out of their people. It sounds ridiculous…and it really is. Intuit goes to great lengths to attract and bring in top talent…and then they simply don’t trust them to do the job they thoroughly vetted and hired them to do in the first place. I am constantly amazed at the amount of time directors and team leaders must have to be able to micromanage their staff all day. Long story short - lack of trust is a VERY big issue at Intuit. It is worse in some areas than others…but it exists throughout. It has gotten worse in the years I have been here.","Create more opportunities / upward mobility for the employees you currently have. Every time you hire for a senior position outside the company, ask yourselves why this candidate had to be external and what could we have done better to ensure the internal employees were being developed to grow into that position. 

You have a really solid hiring process…learn to trust the process and then learn to trust the people you hired to do their job. Lack of trust is felt throughout the “troops” and has created a lot of frustration. People here really feel devalued when they are not allowed to do the job you hired them to do without all of the “shoulder-surfing”. Employees here have some impressive credentials from the colleges they attended to the previous jobs they held. They worked hard to get here...and getting hired here at Intuit is not easy. Get out of their way and allow them to do what you hired them to do. The fact is, you may actually learn from your team if you provide them the opportunity to work with their own creativity and their own experience rather than constantly pushing them to ensure things get done in exactly the manner you would do it. Stick to establishing the high-level direction and goals with your teams and then stay out of weeds unless specifically asked. Your team members will feel more empowered in their jobs and have a better sense of job satisfaction when they know they are being relied on and trusted to drive their specific area.

Stop the childish behavior of creating hierarchical roadblocks. Allow your teams to be seen and heard by execs without all of the constant and time-consuming micromanaging. Your people will never develop the skills of solid, thoughtful, effective executive communication if you are always the one communicating for them. 
One of your main responsibilities as a team leader is to provide your people with the tools and experiences they will need to grow and succeed. Don't lose sight of how important this aspect of being a team leader is. Put your team first - it is not all about you. Trust in the fact that the success and overall happiness of the team will reflect on you and your abilities to lead. No doubt, a team that feels dejected and devalued will reflect on you and your abilities as well.",3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0

The vibe is positive overall in most areas, and they have all the perks a well off company should be providing in the valley: on-site gym, generous 401k match, ESPP, snacks, and well maintained campus. It's no Google, but it's solid in this regard.

There are engaging events for engineers from time to time, such as tech talks and ""engineering days"", where you focus on something unrelated to your work that you're passionate about. It's refreshing to have the chance to develop your skillset while improving the product.

For the most part, very approachable and down to earth management hierarchy. Transparency is one of the things I like the most and greatly appreciate knowing how the team/business is doing and what things we do well and what needs to be improved on.

Opportunity for advancement is certainly available as long as you can navigate the politics well, which I suppose leads me into the ""Cons"" section...","This place reeks of tenured employees that stifle innovation and resist change for the sake of simplicity every chance they get. Big egos with subpar engineering backgrounds pollute the codebase with terrible architectural patterns that get replicated by fledgling developers. This also causes issues with team dynamics, as the louder voices in the room tend to hinder a productive work environment. The resulting toxic culture (and rampancy of politics) is unfortunately my biggest issue with working here.

Organizational structure rotates regularly, so often times your ""mission"" or role is unclear. I've had 3 managers already in my time here, and is sad to spend all that time developing rapport only to have to start over again. 

Mobile is definitely an afterthought but trending in the right direction. A lot of architectural patterns and organizational projects skew toward a more web/backend focused effort. 
 
Compensation is also a frustration point, specifically RSU grants. Quite frankly, they're pathetic given how well the company is doing, and far under what major tech players are paying. If you want your company to be respected in the tech industry, you have to pay your talented engineers well. 
There's also a large disparity between the rating system and comp -- two staff engineers with an identical rating could have RSU amounts that differ wildly enough to bring suspicion of favoritism to the table. I've heard they're working on this though.","De-power the ""problem children"" that are stifling both product innovation and personal growth of the team. Stop changing team structure every 3 months.

Tax DIY is a dying business since many competitors are offering DIY tax prep software for free. Though Intuit tries hard to be a software company, it is not entirely a software company.
