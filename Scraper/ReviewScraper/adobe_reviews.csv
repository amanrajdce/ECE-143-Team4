Tue Nov 12 2019 07:30:14 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Product Manager,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Best company i've worked for,I have been working at Adobe full-time for more than a year,," The company has fantastic work/life balance and gives you a lot of autonomy. If you want to work from home, they're cool with it. If you want to work in the office, they're cool with it. 

- The company genuinely values employees, they want to retain people and will absolutely let you move teams/products/office locations/cities to keep your experience and knowledge in the company rather than watching you walk out. 

- Shantanu 

- Sr mgmt is good, they have experience in the space and have the people management chops to make working easier/enjoyable 

- They have a clear strategy & vision thats guiding their product investments and they communicate it regularly"," It's gets a little crunch-y leading up to product launches or big announcements, but thats kind of expected

- Adobe is a company built on acquisitions, and while the business strategy is usually rock solid, sometimes the comms isn't. It's tough to get any insight about what other business units are doing unless leadership gives a super high level read out during an all hands or there's a specific task that requires collaboration. 

- Some decisions are made from a bit too far up the org chart, things can get a bit ""top heavy"" at times",Find ways to share even higher level info about what other business units are doing and disseminate info across the product silos.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Mon Nov 04 2019 11:16:57 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Marketing Manager,"San Jose, CA",Current Employee ,An Amazing Employer That Wants To Help You Grow,I have been working at Adobe full-time for less than a year,,"A lot of companies expect you to just sit, put your head down, work for 8 hours, and go home. This is NOT that place. Adobe prides itself on its company culture and it shows tremendously through the leadership, its people, and its dedication to innovation. Some cool things about Adobe off the bat: they have a learning fund that encourages you to take classes, go back to school, or even go to conferences to help you develop in your career. There are a lot of on-site events for holidays, volunteer opportunities, and more so there is always something cool going on. Of course the wellness center is pretty awesome (and there are fitness classes you can take), and the food is pretty on point. 

One major thing that has been a refresher is that Adobe and the people who work here really put an emphasis on constructive and positive feedback: everyone here wants you to succeed. That energy carries throughout the workplace. You also feel very empowered to to help others as well, which creates this community and continuous cycle of trust, positivity, and communication. 

I will say this: Adobe is not for the faint of heart. ""Good enough"" isn't enough here. If you're okay with that, and you're an individual who likes to thrive, push, and succeed, then you will fit in just fine. There will be days where you will be putting in your time, and you'll have a 10 hour day. There are some days where you might leave a little early. What I will say is that you WILL take pride in the work you do, and nothing here is meaningless, at least in my opinion.","A work from home option would be nice, but I can also understand why they'd want people in office as it can be very hard to foster a work culture if employees are remote.",Keep doing what you're doing and continue to push the company culture! #AdobeLife,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The workplace is nice--gym is top-notch, cafeteria is great, and other amenities make it an enjoyable work environment. I feel like the company, my manager, and my coworkers all support a solid work/life balance. Not only is there a lot of talent at Adobe, but there's an incredible amount of all-around great people and that makes work even more fulfilling. The company shutdowns (1 week off) at the 4th of July and at Christmas are AMAZING. Flexible PTO, sabbatical of 4-6 weeks every 5 years, $10,000 tuition reimbursement every year, four months paternity leave, 6 months maternity leave, employee stock purchase program with a guaranteed 15% ROI every six months, even if the stock dips. Several times when my family has gone to the dentist or doctor the offices are surprised at how great our health insurance is. There's also a decent amount of internal mobility that happens, so Adobe seems supportive of that.","This is hard...I've been with Adobe four years and it still feels like my dream job. Maybe one thing is that since Adobe is still growing so fast and acquiring companies, it can be challenging to learn so many new things and adapt to be able to support new directions and integration efforts.",Personally I would prefer that when we integrate companies we've acquired to maintain a bit more separation and let them do business as usual.

Especially the shutdowns in July and over New Year's are super valuable (it gives you a real mental break that you otherwise don't get).

(2) The company has a strong monopoly with the Creative Cloud, which brings in huge profits and took the stock price where it is now. 

(3) It is an amazing brand and working for Adobe makes you truly proud.","(1) Level of stress really depends on what product you work for. On the Creative Cloud side everyone is somewhat dispensable (it's a monopoly after all), which means it can be a pressure cooker and very political. How else to stand out?

(2) Given that work/life balance is so amazing, the compensation is a bit lower than elsewhere. I think it's totally fair but something to be aware of.

(3) On the Experience Cloud side, Adobe doesn't have the same level of experience as other companies. Adobe is not a traditional Enterprise software company, which means it's somewhat uneven.

(4) Kind of hard to make a career progression, given how nice the work/life balance is. Arguably it's better to make a career elsewhere and then join Adobe later on in your career.","Keep doing what you are doing.

The work environment is one where colleagues truly care about each other. It may sound simple but it's really motivating to be at a company where employees care so much about each other and the company cares about you- as a person not just another employee. There is also a mindset here where leadership is always questioning the status quo, pushing everyone to think bigger and differently, not get complacent, and to push for disruption if it will make us better. For a company over 30 years old and very successful, it's incredible to see and hear our leaders pushing for new ways of thinking so actively. There is no ""old vs. new"" guard that you might see at other companies. In addition to all this, the offices are gorgeous, comfortable, and creative. Food is excellent and subsidized a lot (not free which I like as there's no waste and less entitlement that what I've experienced at other Valley companies).","No real cons from a working perspective, I could get picky and say the elevators get crowded at lunch time and parking is tough if you show up to work late!","Keep up the mindset of being so welcome to new ways of thinking, fresh perspectives.

- Strong focus on hiring leaders from the outside instead of promoting within
- Low appetite for taking risks
- Lacking in ability for internal innovation that led, more often then not, to acquisitions for growth
- Certain departments were very hesitant to allow any formal work from home programs
- Recent high turnover in tenured employees due to internal drama and a culture that is starting to go down hill
- Unclear organizational leadership at the BU level
- Strong emphasis in diversity that over rotated to a negative bias towards over represented groups ie a perception that certain employees received promotions primarily because of belonging to an under represented gender or race. This includes an internal view by some that others are immune from termination because they fall in an under represented category even if those individuals were under performing",,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

Cool office. Booming company.,"They brought me on as a Jr Technical Writer. They said they would train me and grant me some RSUs that vest in 4 years to convince me into making a long term commitment. Great!

I was initially on a centralized doc team full of writers and a manager *(the guy who hired me) and it was good. 2 years in, they decentralized us and all the writers were split up and put under product organizations. Okay cool. The product manager who became my new manager was a nice guy and a great product manager but had ZERO CLUE how to manage a writer and was mostly nonexistent and just cared that my job was being completed, which it was. This was because he had no idea what my daily duties entailed.

 Both my first manager of 2 years and my 2nd manager had nothing but top reviews and ratings to give me.

Then, the product I was working on got canceled and shipped to India. What did they do to the Jr Writer which they brought on, trained, and gave RSUs to convince him into making a long term commitment? They moved me to a new product, right? No, they just laid me off. Great manager reviews, total loyalty and commitment to Adobe, multiple product knowledge of several products across the cloud, and nope.... they just laid me off. 

A couple of my coworkers even complained up the ladder at how it was handled. But nothing changed. I was picked up by Microsoft a month later, but I still find how Adobe handled the situation very unsettling and unprofessional. They instilled a sense of commitment and loyalty into you... and so I ignored several other opportunities that knocked on my door--only to realize that was a mistake because Adobe didn't care about the commitment and loyalty they squeezed out of me.","Treat your employees like humans, not mere numbers.",1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0

- Working there feels like 1995.
- They have no competition and they make so much money that there is no desire for change.","Listen to your employees when they report harassment - don't turn a blind eye. Don't passively sit there and allow a crazy person to have four teams turn over under them and then blame the team members. 

Start listening to the employees below you, not just trying to constantly appease your boss. Listen to your employees when they tell you about work you do not understand - retain the information, study up on it and learn. Don't come into every 1:1 expecting an explanation of the team they are managing (for over a year). 

In my time there, I was one of six people who reported harassment to their managers where no action was taken. It is accepted and practiced along with victim blaming and gaslighting.

Sun Feb 10 2019 10:18:47 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time),,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Isolation and Offshoring,I worked at Adobe full-time for more than 3 years,6,"Nice office with lots of artwork, generous IT facilities (2 docking stations), food, snacks, cafeteria, generous benefits for BART, Caltrain, and other health / wellness benefits.","Two things were very tough to endure at Adobe: 1. Isolation, 2. Offshoring.

Isolation 

Regarding isolation, this applied to me and my ""coworkers"", but I think others at Adobe were well-integrated with a team. So my experience in the group I worked in could have been unique. But small teams and geographically-distributed teams are subject to LOTS of isolation. In the 3+ years I worked there, I worked in three different physical office buildings, and moved my desk four times. I worked for four different bosses in three remote locations. Most of all, the people I worked with on a day-to-day basis were also geographically dispersed, and, with me moving around a lot, and other people sitting around me moving around, I never felt a sense of community. The people in the desks near me were not on my team and I didn't work with them. Often they were a bit stuck-up, or unfriendly, or from a sales culture that emphasized a ""dressy business casual"" attire for some reason, which was at odds with my more casual garb (despite the fact they were not customer-facing). Moreover, they had little interest in technical subjects, and therefore encounters were often awkward. I always felt under-dressed, but I had no reason to dress up in my role. 

Our group had lots of turnover, so there were constantly new and/or different individuals I worked with. I therefore felt physically isolated, and, a bit psychologically isolated because our team was relatively small and not well-known within Adobe and with customers.

Lastly, there was no good reason given for why I was moved around so much. I almost felt it was at the whims of facilities and/or management.

Offshoring
 
Adobe uses offshoring aggressively for certain teams and I'm not sure why. It didn't work in my department. Resources in India were poorly trained (if at all), stuck in their ways, very bureaucratic, and under the tight control of another managerial organization, so they had little, if any, incentive to work together or get ideas/insight from their counterparts in North America. Most importantly, I found most of my working time spent fixing or redoing a lot of work that was of poor quality that was previously performed by offshore resources. Offshore teams went through significant turnover, but were still firmly in place, even in positions of authority when I left, with a regular set of newcomers to replace people that had resigned or moved to another department. Offshore teams were often extremely slow and error-prone in their work, and often made very bad decisions about processes and tools that had very negative consequences.

Conclusion 

Adobe has lots of great people and products. Unfortunately, in my case, my team at Adobe suffered from much political ""power trips"", isolation, hierarchical, and top-down approaches, and ""upper level"" teams with ""carte blanche"". These people are self-proclaimed experts that will look down at you, always find fault with your work, give no thanks for the hard work and struggles that you do, and generally try hard to bully and make life miserable for you, simply because you are ""below"" them. 

Be careful working at this company. It's a big company, so others' experiences could be more positive. But mine and others were not so pleasant. If you work with offshore teams or in a small or little-known group/department, watch out. The fancy buildings, fancy food, and benefits are nice, but when you are isolated and not respected for your work, that negates all the good things at Adobe.",Seriously evaluate if offshoring is a good idea for certain teams. Don't just shuttle people from desk to desk and from office to office for no good reason.,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0

- Open communication
- Great stock/benefits
- Great amenities and variety in workspace options (open floor, phone booths, lounge areas, etc.)
- Great food options
- Great accommodation for work environment (switching offices, WFH, remote)

Adobe is truly a great company to work for and it shows within the people that you work with. Everyone I've met is incredibly open and my experience so far has been great when it comes to being able to chat with any individual within the company that I am interested in learning from. 

I started off as an intern last summer and was able to return as a full-time employee and it has been great. The company really pushes for work-life balance and to work smarter than work harder. Upper management within my organization is really open to accommodating to talk to, although I know that one's experience in regards to that can vary based on your org. I'm super excited to be starting my professional career at Adobe and look forward to how my career will develop at this company.","Food isn't free, but it is subsidized and definitely worth what you're paying for. If it ever becomes free, that would be great! 

Also based on what I've heard from fellow interns, there is a lot of ambiguity in regards to intern to full-time conversion and I hope that experience would be more defined as I had a lot of my peers experience a limbo of being recommended to have the opportunity to return as a full-time employee but end up not receiving any offer. 

Can be a pro for some, but there is definitely a strong WFH culture and so the office can feel rather empty. Regardless, work gets done which is fine.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

For employees, the company has been doing extremely well with their Cloud offerings so the stock has nearly tripled in price in less than 3 years making a great ROI for employees that get RSUs. Pay is good/ average compared to other companies in the area.

There is no CLEAR path to promotions. Most of the management/ Director positions are filled with external candidates and it is extremely difficult to move up unless you have an executive sponsor. Also, they don't conduct formal performance reviews which could be part of the problem.

Adobe often times prides itself in being one of the BEST places to work but HR works hard on these surveys and they are always asking employees to rate them well.

He even had a dozen years corporate experience with fortune 50 companies.

He apparently was amicable, diplomatic and passionate about joining Adobe and even had a creative background on top of his MBA. But because he didn’t quite fit the ‘profile’ he didn’t get it. Even when the majority of the interview team thought he was the one, but no.

Tue Jul 04 2017 18:56:02 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Incredible place to be.,I have been working at Adobe full-time for more than a year,5," Adobe invests in retaining top talent. Experts land here, and then are incentivized heavily to stay. Thus, if you're fortunate enough to be a junior engineer on a team, chances are good that you'll be surrounded by the very best in the industry to help mentor you. I've found my team to be humble, mature, accomplished, and eager to help me improve my skills.

- Because the engineers here are very much at the top of their game, it makes for a very uncompetitive atmosphere - they have little to prove and are very secure with their abilities. As a result, I've found the teams to be incredibly productive and collaborative.

- Adobe has a thoughtful business strategy. It is stable, focused, and driven. It doesn't get swept up in the typical flashy and silly hype surrounding much of the tech industry. It's fun to be part of this larger, sensible vision.

- I came here because the company placed a high value on ethics. Since I've been here, I've seen that these ethical standards are robust, and it makes for an awesome work environment.

- This is one of the few top tech companies that truly wants you to have a good work-life balance. Adobe understands that their employees perform better when they're not burnt out. Adobe understands that it's better to retain top talent and reduce churn than it is to constantly lose key team members and have to get new employees up to speed. This seems like a no-brainer strategy, but if you look at the industry retention rates, you'll see that few companies understand this.

- It's not a cult. I've not had anyone try to feed me kool aid. I really appreciate this, and probably would have gone elsewhere if this weren't the case. Even though I have a high opinion of the company, I've not ever really expressed this at work - it's simply not part of the culture to bleed for the brand or put on a show about how much you love the company.", I wish its brand were as sexy as some other tech companies.," Keep on keeping on, and so will I.

Adobe as a whole is a great company to work for because of pay(if quota is realistic) and benefits.","Inside Sales is still a mess. Since Adobe is such a large company, it takes too long to get any valuable changes done. We are bleeding reps because upper management can't pull the trigger to fix the issues they created this year in the Sales organization. Which is a much larger issue than just inside Sales. Adobe Sales org is putting itself in a bad position by not moving quickly to fix internal data issues. This is causing people not to get paid, and forcing the top talent to leave, which leaves Adobe with the unsuccessful reps. People are trying to hang on because Adobe is a great company and hope the changes will come; but time keeps on ticking and nothing is yet to change to right size the errors made at the beginning of the year.","Adobe management needs to get their heads out of their ases and do what's best for their employees. If you do what's right for your employees, then the employees do what's right for the customer. It's not rocket science. Someone with authority needs to grow a pair and take charge and start doing what's right. 

Adobe shouldn't be a place people are having to run from. Adobe should be a place where top talent wants to go, not leave.

It does however have a single festering sliver that NEEDS to be pulled. Among the many pros of working at Adobe here are a few: elite/driven people, amazing products, fast innovation, positive global impact, and benefits that cant be beat. At one time there was endless growth possibilities.. that was until the sliver got there.","About two years ago leadership changes were made and a marketer was hired to run the Inside Sales Team. He openly admits that his only sales position throughout his career was a total failure. He claims to be data driven and relies heavily on his data guy. Both guys think the entire company can be driven on data alone, and not real world logic. That is basically the demise of everything that has happened since they both started. To his own detriment he has frequently ignored line management who know better. Every time there is push-back from line management it is likely ignored or those individuals are singled out and caught in his cross-hairs. Its very unfortunate because the managers are only making suggestions to better the company and strengthen the team.

They have cut territories, increased quotas, and hired a large staff of analysts to police the quality of work being done. This staff is being paid nearly a million dollars total per year to micro manage. Pipeline is starting to dwindle because of the lack of production due to unnecessary babysitting.

Morale has never been lower...","Pull the festering sliver! A management change is much needed for the Inside Sales Team, otherwise they will continue to experience high attrition. They need to be replaced with seasoned sales professionals who welcome team collaboration and unity. If Adobe is looking to save money it needs to reconsider the wasteful spending on this analyst team and remove it entirely. Lets Make Adobe Great Again!",3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0
Thu Mar 30 2017 22:59:18 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Inside Sales,"Lehi, UT",Current Employee ,Inside sales- circling the drain,I have been working at Adobe full-time for more than 3 years,15,"Good benefits, fountain coke AND pepsi machines, pearl ice, waterless urinals, free sunglasses, completely sealed gaps in bathroom stalls, natural landscaping, goats, a nice perch to look down on all the point product companies below.","Well.... if you are still reading this you must either be very bored and lonely, a recruiter (seriously guys... you are at a 9 with the Linkedin emails and I need you at a 4), a disgruntled previous employee making sure the grass didn't green back up...(pst... it didn't), perhaps a ""sales"" leader looking for a real opinion...

Or maybe you are a prospective new employee, eager to start your sales career and are looking to base a major career decision on a random, anonymous, TOTALLY unbiased online source (seriously millennials, don't talk to internet strangers). I direct my comments to you though (please take as many grains of salt as your parent's insurance-provided-doctor prescribes). 

You'll notice the other reviewers' chief complaint is with our Sr. dictat... I mean director... to summarize, he has no successful previous sales experience, has insulated himself with a thick layer of mid-level management, armed himself with a fleet of analysts, doesn't listen to any of his more experienced line managers, and targets people who challenge him then warns others to not ask ""career limiting questions."" He tries to come across as genuine but is basically a male version of Dolores Umbridge.

So how does a marketer take control of an inside sales organization? 

The key is to remember that most of the roles in this org involve finding prospective buyers and setting up demos for our sales team. There are a few roles where you work with an AE to close small deals but these are difficult to work your way into and frankly the juice isn't really worth the squeeze once you make it into that. So more than likely you aren't in ""Sales"" (from Adobe's perspective). Sure -- you are developing valuable skills for your future as a sales professional, and many very successful salespeople cut their teeth in this org, but from Adobe's perspective you are a lead generator (not unlike a marketing email, display ad, paid search term, etc). Ultimately, a cost of sales -- and costs are meant to be lowered -- which is exactly what the Sr. Director spends most his time on. 

That's how a marketer takes over an inside sales org. Because somebody who spends more time with spreadsheets then people thought they could lower cost of sales and manage people like a marketing campaign- while simultaneously preparing them for sales careers. 

Hopefully Adobe wises up, replaces top leadership with actual sales professionals who can groom the next generation, and stop the hemorrhaging of great sales talent leaving in droves. 

That being said, maybe you will be the transfusion to replace the lost life blood of inside sales... About 15 spots have opened up and there are a lot more coming soon (like empty first class rooms on the sinking Titanic). Just go in with your eyes open, get Adobe on your resume and then have an exit strategy.

Most of the organization understands the value of flexibility. Jerks are largely clustered under leaders hiring more jerks. 

It's a good company. Experience will largely depend on which organizational and leadership group you are in. They have some good mid-level leaders and some aggressively sub-par ones who drive their employees too hard, but probably don't see as much attrition as they should because the company culture and benefits are good overall. 

Most of the mid-level management privately express concerns about how intensely we've hired in India, how they are blocked from hiring elsewhere, how challenging it is to find staff with a mindset of attention to detail, quality work, and an understanding of how to communicate internationally. They are generally afraid to communicate this to executives. Key executive positions are held by talented Indian leaders who do not appear to understand the extent of these cultural difficulties in hiring at an individual contributor level. Back office and IT are largely a mess because UX focus has been customer-centric for so long, and many small development mistakes have been introduced into systems. Leadership and hiring there could be improved as the complexity of the environment increases.","Most groups need tools and ideas to better manage the volume of meetings and emails consuming people's time. Open work environment increases collaboration and team bonding, in some cases, but reduces productivity as people find it difficult to maintain flow, or abandon their cubicles to find quiet spaces and less movement, despite a desire to work near their teams.","Help your employees get more effective work done. Fix the back office employee experience and systems through better tools, automation, ideas, and/or hiring. And reduce the amount of inexpensive manual labor you are throwing at the problem long term. Large, complex challenges can usually be fixed through intelligent collaboration, clever ideas, targeted and better hiring in leadership. Develop, research, or better disseminate the correct best practices. Where system complexity is high, temporarily spend the time/effort getting leadership (or heaven forbid consulting) in the top 1% in these key areas, rather than the top quarter. Further develop processes and culture that allow the best ideas to pass through the environment rather than layers of leadership.",4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0

Comp package, benefits, employee stock plan and the #AdobeLife is elite. ""I Don't Like it, I Love It,"" by Flo Rida and Robin Thicke wrote this jam about Adobe.","Only one problem: Inside Sales leadership. There are no leaders in management, though they have the titles, they cannot do their jobs because their leader appears to be dishonest, condesending and threatened his entire org during the most recent all-hands meeting, to not ask “career limiting questions,” regarding their quotas going up 40% to 125%. Any managers that challenge his ideas are pushed out. His pride is killing Inside Sales at Adobe.

Employees aren't heard, valued or respected. Twelve (12) from Inside Sales have left in the past month, but whats scarier is the amount of people actively looking. When it==the max exodus occurs they won’t care, but they won’t even see if coming because they think all is well in Zion. There are many more that will be gone by the Summer. Our leadership actually reached out to another local company that hired some of the Adobe employees, and demanded that company end existing interviews with all Adobe employees. The evdence is the emails that company sent to the interviewing Adobe employees. HR violation or not, that’s how this leadership behaves. They don’t listen and they think they can solve problems, but with no sales leaders in upper management they often misdiagnose the problem and the solutions just compound problems. This is not just a Lehi problem as two from San Jose left in the last two weeks. Our leadership will handpick specific people and situations and use that best case scenario as the typical example of how things should work every single time.

Leadership has raised quota 4 times mid-year in the last 22 months. Once you hit your number, they move the number back then brag about how they removed the cap that the last leader had. We miss that guy. After one such quota change they retroactively took money from an entire team of ADMs, totaling thousands per ADM. Retroactive folks! He has taken away entire revenue streams, not paid out spiffs, forced ADMs to compete against the field team and doesn’t provide cover over the top when we attempt to execute his plan against our field teams. We have “new quality standards” that are simply just busy work for him to report up some awesome new changes. All of this would be fine if we were being compensated properly to deal with his drama, but production has fallen off a cliff and he bragged that gives him more credibility as a leader. He may be delusional, narcissistic or just threatened by A+ players. I will admit, I’m not a doctor. I have heard comparisons to Lord Farquad, but I have not seen the movie Shrek, so I cannot comment. During our company Christmas party one of the white elephant gifts was rolls of toilet paper with his likeness custom printed on the ultrasoft. Many fought over that gift. During one exit interview he was called out on his threat to the org regarding “career limiting questions” and he denied ever making that comment. He forgot its recrded and that it was attended by nearly 150 people. It’s also cute that he personally posted a positive review of the great job he’s doing here at Adobe, lol. Now he has the other Inside Sales managers posting positive reviews on Glassdoor. Now you know you’re desperate…","Focus on us and not the field sales team. Fix our org problems. Every new change is for the field and not your own org (TBP, Value Prompter, Auditor team). Just save face and fix our problems. We don’t need or want an apology because we don’t value public perception over production. With your Director title, you are accountable to fix it. No one is right all the time and we don’t hold it against you until you start lying and talking to us like we’re children. Don’t tell us that it’s a good thing that our quota doubled and then tell us we’re being recognized as a high performer when you give us a 20% quota raise tax on top of everyone else on our team.
