Great benefits including health, dental, vision, commuter subsidy, cell phone, health/wellness subsidy, and more. Outside of work specialty events such as company picnic and holiday party were a blast. Great support teams for employee on-boarding. Fun work environment and great community of people to work around.","Don't let the food distract you from what is going on. I was merely hired as a diversity box to check. Upper level leadership states that diversity and inclusion are ""important"" and a ""high-priority"" but in researching the trends of POCs and women in the Dropbox workplace, you will see that there are major swings, not allowing for POCs to get comfortable in the workplace. You will also be paid less than your counterparts who are in the same role, with the same level of experience but display a less diverse demographic background. ERGs were great to find community in but that message needs to not only be a safe space to find community but it should mean something to upper level leadership. 

Dropbox promotes people into positions of power who have never lead a team before and who should never be allowed the opportunity to offer guidance to other human beings. There is zero intention behind the hiring and separation process which directly displays the patriarchal, ""Boy's Club,"" stigma of the Bay Area Tech Industry.

If you want to make an impact here, I highly suggest knowing someone higher up and not deviating from their ideologies. New and differing ideas are not welcomed from my understanding.

There is also not a very clear direction that this product is heading in. There are multiple different value propositions, giving employees the feeling of having their hands in too many buckets at one time. There is also no clarity on who to turn to when trying to problem solve.","Be intentional about your hiring and promotion process. Often times length of service, age, traditional tech industry demographics, or technical acumen does not directly correlate to high quality leadership.

TLDR: Dropbox, by far, was for me the best candidate experience, and after I was hired, my onboarding was thoughtful, seamless, reasonably paced, and there were no culture shocks or surprises—everybody has been so kind; also, Dropbox has awesome values that put people first (both employees and users). 

+ The recruiter was exceptionally kind and thoughtful, as well as deeply knowledgeable about their area of focus. They were genuinely advocating for me every step of the interview process. 

+ The general approach and philosophy was assessing mutual fit, both for culture and for the technical aspects of the role I was applying for. It was explained that this was a conversation, and there was no rush to get me through the funnel. This was awesome because many other companies play the numbers game and just try to get people through. Dropbox's approach feels more human and respectful.

+ Every interview I met with throughout my interview process was engaging, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and attentive. I've been in interviews at other companies where people are literally falling asleep in our 1:1 or on their phone during my presentation.

+ The documentation and resources are extensive and well organized. For new employees, there's a good balance between in-person instruction/coaching/onboarding and self-serve.

+ The benefits are outstanding. Probably some of the best in the industry.

+ Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion seems to be real here, and not just paid PR lip service.

+ Dropbox does seem to value work/life balance.

+ Dropbox has a clear leveling system with a clear career framework for assessing real business impact as a way to objectively promote employees.","+ Like all companies, Dropbox isn't a perfect machine, and every team is different. So, you should be prepared to come in with fresh eyes, get to know your team's strengths and weaknesses, and bring your expertise to bear on processes and collaboration.

Tuck Shop food is really good. The Wellness Benefit is large and you can use it on a very wide variety of equipment and services. Company matches donations up to a certain amount.

Work Environment

Some parts of the engineering organization are strong: Magic Pocket, sync, and machine learning stand out. Hack Week lives on.

HelloSign Acquisition
The company may have realized that it is organizationally/culturally not equipped to grow organically and now seems willing to acquire for growth.","Weak Strategic Thinking
""Evolving"" strategy as each year's strategy proved to not work. Each year's strategy is based on models of the industry where either the model is unconvincing or it is not at all clear why Dropbox's approach is the winning one.

Passive Aggressive Culture
People are always friendly face to face but beneath the veneer there is a lot of jockeying for power. Power distribution is evident when prizes projects get done by in power teams even though the area is theoretically another team's area of responsibility. People assign overflow tasks to other people even though they are responsible for it. People initially promise to do work and then shirk it without repercussions.

Politics
Ultimately unsuccessful projects were created and pushed out the door to get people promoted. Many people jump on board early on and generate immediately ridiculous shoddy user research to back up the work. Shallow technology is hyped as awesome and weak initial indicators are seen as good. Many of the promoted people still remain or get promoted even further up to do more damage.

Promotions are based on getting backing from managers and hopping on board initiatives that staff engineers or managers push. Each new set of staff engineers or managers disparages the work of the previous set and advocates for their own work. No one is willing to push back against what they say.

Levels are uneven with some staff or senior engineers/QA who are anything but that. Long time mediocre people are accumulating. Some title inflation for new hires.

-Work/life balance

-Benefits
-There are a lot of chances for ownership and a ton of work still to be done.

-The people are great. Dropbox is incredible at finding a diverse range of high quality people.

-Diversity.

-The company culture is very inclusive.

-Still has the feel of a much smaller company.","People are churning out very fast in the past 9-12mo.

-Busy work is rewarded. A lot of people put out a ton of ""work"", but very little has impact. The volume of work is often used by people to vouch for promotion, bonuses, or transfer to higher roles in other teams.

-Reorgs. The company has had 6 internal re-orgs on teams I have been on since I joined. Imagine working on a project for 6 months, getting everything in line and then leadership decides to do something completely different. This makes it super hard for many people to actually accomplish something start to finish.

-A lot of teams are made up mostly by people who come in through the Dropbox Rotation Program out of school. I find that these teams are highly tribal, not open to criticism, and often do not do very high quality work but know how to play the system very well.

-Peer review process is hit or miss and a lot is open to what feedback your managers choose to include. Moreover if you move to another team you can often be ""re-leveled"" and miss out on promotions or career path opportunities.

-Due to there being so much work to be in certain divisions, a lot of time is wasted on things that have minor impact. On one hand employees milk this because it makes them look like they do a ton of informative work, but on the other hand if you look at things from the big picture we learn slowly and can't scale ideas well.","Stop reorganizing divisions every few months.

-Invest more in data quality and analytics..

-Stop letting relatively inexperienced or junior staff interview technical candidates with more experience. You miss out on so many amazing candidates because the interviewer is simply not on the candidate's skill or communication level.

-Tuck Shop is cool, but you should trend towards serving healthier options. It becomes patronizing after the initial awe wears off.",2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,dropbox

There are generous stipends for transit, wellness, learning and development (books and conferences), and others. Dental, vision, and health are all covered. There is donation matching up to a $1000 per year, unlimited volunteer and paid time off (which, if you're daring enough to request, truly seems unlimited—I have yet to hear of someone's PTO request being declined), and if you're in an office with a Tuck Shop, world-class food served every day. You can gift Dropbox space to friends and family.

The culture values kindness and open-mindedness to a fault, and teams are given massive autonomy to work and ship as they see fit. This means you can have very different experiences depending on your team and manager. This also means if you see something broken, you're generally given the OK to go and fix it if you have the will.

There are company events throughout the year, including team offsites (I've been hiking, on a cruise, to an escape room, and to countless dinners and happy hours), guest speakers, parties, etc. Dropbox seems to spare no expense on events and travel, although I've heard it was even more extravagant in the past.","Dropbox lies squarely in the ""ruinous empathy"" quadrant of business culture. Promotions are measured by the number of friends you make, not the results you achieve, which results in decision making by committee and projects that lag on for months at a time because nobody is willing to take ownership or say ""no."" At the same time, projects spanning 6+ months of research, design, and engineering can be derailed by the opinion of a single manager in the pursuit of ""perfect"" rather than ""better"".

Staff lack a clear vision for Dropbox. Milquetoast strategy updates and new opportunities receive endless bravado but when it comes to actual execution there's little follow-through. Meanwhile, the core Dropbox product continues to suffer from longstanding problems like convoluted sharing and horrendously slow performance.

We use Dropbox Paper, our own docs offering, for absolutely everything—from project management to calendaring to to-do lists to meeting notes. What results is total chaos. There is no sane way to organize docs, which get produced at an astounding rate: product managers regularly compose dozens of new Paper docs in any given week. There is no way we would organize ourselves this way if we weren't so committed to using and abusing our own tool.

Simple bugfixes languish in backlogs for months or years without resolution. Abysmal developer tools and nonexistent analytics slow the company to a crawl. 

We talk a big talk about ""designing a more enlightened way of working"" (corporate thinkpieces go up on the blog every few weeks) but how can we hope to improve work for others when our own house is a mess?

All these issues aren't new, and they're well-known to anyone who has been in the organization for longer than a year. We will talk about them and collectively agree they need to be addressed, but for whatever reason, nothing ever seems to happen.","LEAD. Where are you? From down on the ground, seems like you've tapped out. Commit to a direction and see it through. Hold people accountable for results and set real deadlines. Fix the basics.

Standardize from the top down. We aren't a startup anymore, but we still act like one. We need standard platforms and processes across the org for project management, hard requirements for shipping, easily accessible analytics for *all* teams, and a continuous, direct line of communication with customer success so we understand the real problems that users are facing, not the problems we make up for our user personas to face.

Treat remote offices as first-class citizens. There's a lot of thrash that most likely goes unnoticed in SF. Check in to see how people are doing.

So far I've been very pleasantly surprised to learn that the culture and environment is even better than I had expected. After having worked at several large tech companies in the area, I have realistic expectations when it comes to culture and work environment and often after seeing behind the curtains am disappointed with the results, however here I haven't seen anything that is popping that bubble. Even though we work in a satellite office (the HQ is in San Francisco) they are very careful to ensure that we maintain that environment that makes Dropbox special, as well as including everyone and being very transparent so that we don't end up feeling like a lonely island. 
*Benefits here are amazing (even compared with Microsoft, Facebook and the like)
*Perks include having a catered breakfast, lunch & dinner (if you are going to be working past 5) every day. If you are lucky enough to work in the SF office, then you have your own restaurant with options crafted by a Michelin star chef. We also have a fully stocked kitchen and full bar. We also have a lounge area complete with Xbox One & Sega (old school), full band set-up, pool table, foosball, ping pong table and lots of different working spaces for any kind of work environment requested. 
*Company founders are onsite and super accessible, they really do care about each and every employee and put a lot into everything.

The transparency here is amazing, and if you have an idea or want to try something new out, I've been met with ""yes"" every time. Which is amazing and can offer up unlimited career progression, just don't be afraid to get in and get your hands dirty and get 'er done.","The only con I can find is the location, although we are in the Columbia Tower and the views are seriously the best in the city, I live on the Eastside and thus commute is a headache for me. Luckily we have a generous transportation benefits and a flexible work environment, so I can work from home as needed. The bus routes are the hardest part, trying to find one that will work with my schedule has needed a little work, but that's not really the fault of Dropbox.","Continue to keep the transparency intact, that's a very important part of this culture and the success of the product itself, so it's great to have that to showcase. As we are still very much growing, and growing at a very fast pace, it's important to make sure that we continue to hire people who will maintain that uniqueness that keeps us at Unicorn status, I've seen cases where bringing in the wrong leadership can tank an entire product line, so that's my biggest worry at this point.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,dropbox

This is a great place to start your career if you're entry-level.","All that glitters isn't gold. Despite the glitz of the perks, many people at Dropbox are really unhappy. This is due to several things:
- Bad managers. Like, really bad. Very little training offered to new managers, and the company does not take action on managers who are consistently rated poorly or who have a lot of turnover on their team.
- Very little career development. If you're mid-to-senior level and you're looking for autonomy and responsibility, this is likely not the place for you.
- Dropbox is NOT a meritocracy. Many leveling and compensation decisions are based on favorites and are inconsistent from team to team, or level to level.
- Despite being a relatively small company, it's tough to get things done. Weighed down by red tape and bureaucracy. If you're someone who is execution-oriented and likes to move fast, look elsewhere.","Stick to the values and raise the hiring bar. Stop hiring and promoting bad managers. Train new managers, and get rid of the ones who aren't effective. Provide greater development and mentorship opportunities for people who want them. Hire a more seasoned and effective HR team.

Internally the culture and practices have really matured as well. Lots of investment in engineering tools and people development that didn't exist before. 3 years ago Dropbox was much less formal about this and it meant that if you were passive you might not get the feedback/opportunities you need to grow. These days that's fixed with the company investing lots in building up its people and helping them to find the right opportunities that fit them.

I'm still very optimistic about the business. Dropbox's renewed focus on enterprise (while still supporting a best-in-class consumer product) is unlocking a huge revenue stream and the team is laser focused on building it right. Given recent revenue, the 10B valuation seems pretty fair."," still some growing pains, but overall the company has become much more mature!

Certainly not from a company with a couple hundred engineers. On a day-to-day basis, that means that the impact any particular engineer can have is HIGH.

The overall philosophy at Dropbox seems to be, ""hire the best people you can find, and give them the freedom to do their thing."" On the engineering side, this means the team is friendly, smart, and eager to help each other, making it a great place to learn.

That same philosophy applies outside of engineering, as well. Take the tuck shop (cafe), for example: Chef Brian and Chef Danny have hired great talent and given them the latitude to be creative, and as a result Dropbox has the best company food I've come across. My friends at Google love coming to Dropbox for lunch because the food is such a treat.","Dropbox is making the transition from a startup to a real company. And that means having the downsides of both a startup and a real company.

The real company downsides are pretty familiar: there's not as much openness as at a small company, you can get stuck with a lousy manager or on a project that gets canned, there's things you can't know and hoops you have to jump through for confidentiality/strategy/compliance reasons, etc.

The small company downsides are also real: your stock is monopoly money, there's a lot of uncertainty, and if you get stuck with a lousy manager, there might not be the systems in place to deal with it.

My biggest concern personally is that leveling and career progression seems fairly haphazard. Reviews have happened about twice a year since 2014, and every single review cycle has used a different set of criteria. And they're developing a new one for this fall's reviews. On some level, the things that make you a good engineer are universal across evaluation frameworks, but on another (e.g. does the system emphasize how well you facilitate other teams' work or how well your team executes its own tasks) it can make a pretty substantial difference.","The current management framework puts managers in a position of having to choose between company values and their team's OKR's. Different managers will err in different directions when it comes to that tension. Consider how values and OKR's map to each other.

Well over half the company has joined within the past two years. Spend more time with those people; they're who will be driving the company forward.",5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,dropbox

And unfortunately those layers are overly controlling. Managers do not control their teams or pretty much any decisions within their teams, from hiring, structure, communications, even strategy or logistics. The main function of manages becomes to run meeting logistics, be a point person for recruiting, and taking the heat for any problems.

Most folks in the company are very young, including most leadership, and do not have the perspective to understand that this is not typical and does not allow leadership to thrive or develop. There is much hand-wringing about how to develop good leadership, training programs being rolled out, etc. But I'm afraid that without working on reducing the culture of micromanagement that has developed, they're focusing on the wrong things to cultivate strong and experienced leadership, much less retention of those leaders.","Let your managers do what they're good at.

- Unclear career path, especially in satellite offices; dozens of people have left for other offices with better opportunities
- Bro culture on the sales side with a local ""leader"" who is unable to relate to anyone not exactly like him
- Because of the above point, attempts at diversity are feeble and just for show

Unfortunately, there aren't many of them left in the office... 
- The perks are great. It's nice to not have to worry about food, and the health benefits are better than in most companies I've seen. 
- The office location is in the heart of downtown and the building has a great rooftop deck and gym in the basement."," For enterprise sales, you are promised high multipliers coming into the company, while less than 10% of the AEs on the enterprise team made their quota in 2015, so very few people ever reach these supposed numbers and most end up making less than they did before they came to Dropbox. The MM reps have the same quota whether their territory is NYC or Kansas (they consider a knowledge worker in one state equivalent to another) so quota achievement in that group is almost entirely based on whether you get a good territory. 
- The senior sales management in Austin is the worst I have ever worked with in my career. Countless sales females who were working in Austin have left the company, moved to other offices, or switched teams to get away from it. To date, there are no female sales managers in Austin and any female who could have been promoted, but who has disagreed with them, has been run off, leaving only newly hired people to choose from. 
- Inexperienced people in the company are given authority and power to do things they should not be allowed to do, i.e. the territories for the entire sales team were cut by someone 1-2 years out of school with no background in finance or consulting. 
- There is a clear lack of communication and coordination between teams in and around sales, which leads to a lot of confusion and course correction from week to week. It's hard to focus on selling when you have to keep track of so many things outside sales that affect your day to day. 
- The focus from the company is on the ""wedding not the marriage"" when it comes to sales. They do everything to help bring you in the door, but once there, there is little done towards retaining top talent which has led to an exodus of some of the best sales reps over the past months. 

Overall, know what you're getting into when joining Dropbox. There are still good people here and if you can find a good manager, you can create an enjoyable work environment. Unfortunately, with the senior sales management currently in Austin, I would recommend the other offices over this one, especially as a female.",,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,dropbox

- If you're looking for a small, scrappy start up, we're not longer that. Processes are harder than ever to get through - people aren't on the same page (including the people who should be running them). There are layers upon layers of management and approvals needed that things sometimes take weeks to turnaround.

- We care more about what we are perceived to the outside world than valuing our employees. We work so hard to recruit talent but don't carve out paths or reward systems for them once they join. 

- Line and mid level managers are very junior IE this is the first management experience they have, and the training they receive leaves you with a hammer and no nails. On top of this, some of the best engineers are asked to move in to management when they don't desire to be, which really doesn't help anyone. 

- A lot of the company is built on referrals, which really doesn't help with diversity (of social, economic, or thought). People who think differently aren't encouraged to continue the conversation.

There is ownership in the work and it's easy to feel bought into what the company is trying to accomplish. There is a strong sense of community outside of work. The culture promotes continuous learning and provides the resources to do so; for instance, if someone wanted to learn how to code, play a new instrument, or learn a new language, it's very easy to do so at work. There is an interest group for pretty much anything you can think of, from soccer to poker to smash bros to Taylor Swift, which makes it easy to meet others and keep hobbies active.
- The talent bar has managed to stay incredibly high despite the increase in company size. There is probably no other group of 1,000+ individuals working on the same product as smart and talented as the team at Dropbox. Even though everyone is insanely smart and accomplished, people are unbelievably down to earth, approachable, and nice. In a recent internal survey of what it meant to be 'Dropboxy', humble was the most cited response by far.
- Have personally not had issues with work / life balance, but some individuals have probably had unfortunate experiences. I feel the company provides enough ownership and responsibility that one has control over work schedule and cadence, leading to much more predictability in hours. Even if I have a lot of work, I can still make plans on any day of the week, honor them, and finish up afterward from home if necessary. Increased ownership also means I'm directing my work more, so I don't find myself re-doing work unnecessarily. Only times I've worked longer hours are because I've wanted to do so on my own accord.
- Business is strong. A lot of external criticism regarding valuation and how well the business is actually doing, but company is on a growth trajectory most companies wish they could ever experience. Senior executive bench is stacked (COO, CFO, VPs); Dropbox has managed to bring in incredibly impressive individuals who've accomplished a lot at other companies.
- Compensation and perks are benchmarked to be among the top in the valley. Food is definitely the best in the valley, and probably of any corporate environment in the world."," Regarding point above on business being strong, Dropbox cannot say it has won. Cloud storage / collaboration space is very competitive with giants like Microsoft and Google wanting a piece. Company appears to lack a sense of urgency given success to date, but needs to keep pushing forward to sustain growth.
- To maintain extremely positive culture, a sub-culture of conflict aversion seems to have developed. Leads to some group think.
- Related to above, company has a hard time with having difficult conversations and making difficult decisions. More prevalent in inexperienced decision makers who want every piece of information and unanimous decision making, instead of just making a call.
- As company scales, increased emphasis is placed on processes and planning, which can make things feel more bureaucratic and progress is being made at a slower pace than it could be.", Need to establish an unambiguous product strategy.

- Whenever Dropbox makes a public announcement, employees are encouraged to the point of cajoled into leaving positive comments and favorable reviews on public forums with personal accounts (""Don't forget to upvote the announcement on Hackernews! But don't do it on the office wifi because that can trigger a spam alert..."", etc).
- Troubling company value: We not I. This means that you should put Dropbox before your own personal wellbeing. Employees that make personal sacrifices for the benefit of the company are deified at the all hands meeting.
- Cross-functional communication or collaboration is effectively impossible without the involvement of a manager or three, as everyone is worried only about completing their own sprint goals. The ""start-up mindset"" is useless for a 1000+ person corporate entity.
- Interviews and hire decisions are conducted in a very haphazard and non-transparent way, with more than a few interviewees mysteriously turned away after a consensus ""hire"" decision. 
- If you're not a 22 year old, male, Stanford/MIT/Carnegie Mellon grad or a Facebook/Google alumn, prepare to feel very out of place and marginalized.
- Good work goes unacknowledged unless you are a relentless self-promoter or part of the in-crowd. With respect to code, quantity counts more than quality.
- Working hours regularly extend late into the night. I once tried to hold a 10:30 am meeting, and was told by a manager that this was ""ridiculously early"". Another time, I came into the office around 11 PM to pick up something that I had forgotten, and it was half full with people working and playing video games.
- Consequently, important business decisions get made during non-standard business hours, so when you come into work at 9 AM, you'll be greeted with an inbox full of new decisions, priorities and tasks.
- Heavy drinking is commonplace at most official and non-official company functions, and opting-out is seen as being ""not part of the team"". When many of your coworkers/managers end up at a bachelor party in Vegas, you will definitely hear about it at your next sprint planning meeting.
- Gossip-y. Again, if you're not in the in-crowed, you will be at its mercy.
-- This extends to HR. Do not share anything with HR that you don't want your manager and coworkers to also know.
- Rampant entitlement among employees. At dinner, one can frequently overhear such gems as ""I'm too good for MUNI"" and ""Well it's easier for women to get hired, so that's probably why she was hired and not X (male person)"".

Summarily, I felt that my career prospects would be limited as I was not part of the in-crowd, and unwilling to put in 60 hour weeks among less-than-desirable company. Ultimately though, Dropbox will continue to make buckets of money despite its troubling culture.",,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,dropbox

The perks and benefits are good, and people use them. Free food is the norm in tech these days, but what Tuck Shop turns out is unlike anything I've seen at any other company. Actually, that doesn't do it justice. The Tuck Shop turns out food that can go toe-to-toe with any trendy SF restaurant you can name. Or you can always get a sandwich, a burger, pizza, or salad, if you're of the less adventurous type (but what's the fun in that?)

There's also a slew of other benefits: health/vision/dental, 401k match, donation match, commuter benefit, cell phone, gym (both on-site w/ free laundry and a $100/month subsidy for an outside gym), basically, you name it, Dropbox has it.

The culture embraces the fact that people work better when they have breaks, so people actually use their vacation days. And people work pretty flexible hours.","The pace of growth brings some problems. For one thing, everyone has to spend a lot of time interviewing potential new Dropboxers. For another, growth means every week there are more desks and fewer marginal spaces (e.g. couches) until we get more office space, and the people you're sitting next to today are unlikely to be the people you're sitting next to two months from now.

For most, the constant obsession with improving the product and our internal procedures is probably the biggest draw. If you have a good idea, MGMT is very receptive to criticism of the status quo, and moves quickly to improve. Sense of ownership over work. 
-People: Biggest perk is the people -- really enjoy spending time with my colleagues. Very familial. I am in a satellite office (Austin) so I don't know if this is the same as in SF, but it is very closely knit here. Also - I'm gay, and it has never come up as an issue (not that I am very surprised, but it is worth noting). We have a very supportive queer community in the office, going to LGBT events in town, etc. I rarely feel like an outsider, even though most of the office is straight. 
-Work-life: Although my colleagues are all very hard workers, they also have a lot going on outside of work. One has a top-rated EE Cummings poetry blog, another is working on releasing a rock EP, or is playing a show at a bar down the road, or is doing standup comedy, or inviting people to go volunteer at a local school, or go to an art show etc etc... everyone has an interesting life outside of work, and really cares about engaging with Austin. I think that is rare in a lot of organizations, where the conveniences offered by an office, and the drive to succeed, isolate employees from forming roots where they life. 
-Hiring: I have done some interviewing for prospective candidates, and the training is very value-oriented. I think we attract top talent, sure, but if the person doesn't contribute in some way, or bring a diverse viewpoint into the organization, then the talents will not meant as much. Good balance of finding good workers + human beings. Makes me comfortable to know that, as we grow, the org will still be filled with people you care about, outside of work relationships. 
-Transparency: management is super, super open. This might change as we grow, but they work hard to keep everyone in the loop.","The rate of change here is very fast -- which is great in many ways (rarely boring, easy to address flaws, etc) and is something I was attracted to at first.

Across the company, I've worked on meaningful projects with incredibly-smart people.","Work-life balance is a tricky thing at a company that's doing so many different things and growing in so many different directions.

At Dropbox, though, the flexibility I have with my hours and working from anywhere other than the office makes me even more productive, surprisingly. All I really need is my computer and wi-fi. 

This allows me to have a work-life balance, and it allows me to cater to my kids' needs whenever I need to. I can be there for my kid's doctor's appointment, I can be there to pick my kids up and drop them off, I can stay at home and work from home if my kid is sick, etc. etc. The flexibility is incredible, and your leads/managers trust you as long as you get the job done, and done well.

The benefits for my family are great, as well. And the number of times they have Dropbox Family Night or Dropbox Kids Night is incredible. I have never wanted to bring my family to my work this much. The team in charge of all these family events really puts their heart into making sure the food and activities are one to remember.","Given how many non-tech ""office jobs"" I've had in the past, I seriously cannot complain about ANYTHING when it comes to Dropbox.

When I was looking at tech companies, I was fortunate enough to be considered at places like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Frankly, I didn't really seriously consider Dropbox until I received a call from a recruiter who had received my resume, and wanted to set up a phone screen. Wow - was I missing out on the best place to work in the valley right now. Upon receiving an offer here, there was zero question or doubt in my mind about accepting - Google could have come back with all the compensation in the world, but the opportunity to help build the next big thing at Dropbox was unparalleled. Here are a few of the reasons I decided to join, and love working here:
- There's no bureacracy at this place. Sure, we are still small-ish (about 700 now, about 500 when I started), but things just get DONE. There isn't a lot of 'approval' and 'review' for little changes that need to be made or for ideas that folks want to give a whirl. Such a refreshing process.
- The leadership team is phenomenal. There is no hiding behind walls (literally - even our co-founders sit in our open-space desk arrangement amongst everyone else) and they are available and accessible. Exec. team is super grounded and humble, and this allows us to grow in a healthy way, because egos don't get you anywhere here.
- The opportunity that is available is the KEY to joining this place. If you are willing to work super hard and get your hands dirty, you will be able to join products, drive initiatives, and actually get stuff done. Your work doesn't feel menial -it feels like you are actually helping to grow this place.
- The PERKS are just as fabulous (if not more) than any other hot tech company. Why? Because we are still growing, so the perks feel super customized and high touch. There is plenty of pitching myself here because I wonder how I landed this gig. It's a dream."," It's honestly so fun and social that I sometimes worry about my non-Dropbox life and if I am giving it enough attention. By all means, it is my decision to stay for dinner, happy hours, and other social activities, and there is no pressure to do these things, but they have created such a great environment here that it is easy to get roped in and abandon other parts of your life. Disclaimer: Dropbox is NOT a place that does not support work/life balance. Everyone gets to choose how involved they become!
- Some growing pains. As we hire like crazy this year, we will (and are) experiencing slight growing pains like having the company split into different buildings (they are a 5 minute walk apart, but still changes the dynamic). Inevitable, though, at a company that is succeeding.","Keep doing what you are doing, and don't sell out to politics as we grow!

One of the biggest benefits i've experienced has been the people - you truly get to work with insanely smart, talented people who are genuinely fun to work with - and this is the result of an intense hiring process that screens out a lot of great candidates. Office perks in SF are fantastic (particularly the world class food) and they're getting better at the remote offices. (Side note about remote offices - they are treated with the same level of importance as the SF office, we get tons of visitors, and people in SF make a point of keeping us informed about what's going on.) Compensation is generally in line with similar positions in the market, depending on role. The company is growing quickly (but responsibly), so there is ample opportunity to grow as new teams are being formed regularly.","The San Francisco office is a bit crowded right now due to rapid growth and the open seating plan; this can make it difficult (but not impossible) to focus on work. Although decisions at the founder level are very transparent to the whole company, some teams don't enjoy the same level of transparency from middle-management.

The decision making process at the exec level is really transparent, so you get to learn a lot on a broader company level (what our 3/6/12 month goals are, why they are that way, what we could of done better in the last year, etc.). There are times when I feel like part of my job is getting paid to go to business school, how awesome is that?

There are a lot of great people here to help teach you ""stuff"". (Sorry for the engineers reading this part, I'll let our eng gals and guys speak more to that sphere). You want to learn Photoshop? SQL, Hive, Python, how our infrastructure works? It is nice to know that you can never stop learning. 

Especially for those of us early in their career, a culture of learning and getting connected with the right people and teams is crucial. It is also nice to know that it is at a company that is not yet 3, 5, 10, or 30 thousand people... Lots of opportunities, lots of growth ahead, easier to navigate and learn from different parts of the business, etc. Not trying to say big corporations don't have great opportunities, just that they have different ones.

I could go on and on about perks. But I won't. Besides the Tuck Shop... their food is legendary. Also, +1 to the kickass office space... and the kickass office team! 

What else? Truthfully, some of my closest friends in San Francisco are dropboxers, in and outside of the office. It's also important to note that many of my professional mentors and leaders that I look up to are also here. It's nice to have that spectrum of choice :)

My leads (""managers"") have all exposed me to different expertise and ways of thinking. I've reported to a cofounder of a startup we've acquired, a military vet with an MBA, a consultant that worked in London and Russia, and a former professional Drummer that played on stage at Lollapalooza.

I learn from sales people, I learn from engineers, I learn from designers, I learn from our COO, our CFO, our cofounders, and just about every other single person at this company. I wake up relatively stoked to come in to the office and feel satisfied enough to leave at a reasonable hour. I take vacations. Sometimes I leave at 4pm, sometimes 5 or 6, sometimes 9. I enjoy my weekends. I have built solid skills set entirely at work. I don't drink the Koolaid, it is just really hard not to be happy here when you work with fun, smart, and friendly people.

One of the best pieces of advice I received growing up was ""surround yourself with people that are smarter than you"". We have leaders in design, engineering, and business. My teammates and friends at Dropboxer never cease to impress me. Sometimes, I wish it was me that felt like Einstein, but for now I am completely content with feeling like Curious George. The efforts and outputs of my peers both push me and remind me that there is plenty more to learn, and PLENTY more to do.","Structure and career pathing isn't *yet* as defined as it would be at a Google or Facebook. But what do you expect? We are currently ~700 employees and last year at this time we were ~250 - of course there are going to be some growing pains.

--I consistently find my co-workers to be unbelievably smart, incredibly driven, and entirely dedicated to company success over the long term. Everyone 'gets it' across the whole company, from sales to recruiting to engineering. It makes it fun to problem solve as a team.

--We're working on some incredibly tough, highly motivating problems. Few companies deal with the amount of data and global footprint we manage and seek to expand on a daily basis. It's an exciting, big challenge, and invigorating every day.

--The culture and company morale are outstanding, buoyed by a great team combined with delightful daily experiences like the Tuck Shop or awesome new Dropbox swag.

- Level of ownership over your work or projects is unparalleled, in my experience. I have had the opportunity to work on impactful projects within my own team as well as cross-functionally, and if you're on a project, you have a voice at the table - no matter how senior-level that table may be.
- Senior management is very transparent - open Q&A every week, board meeting reviews, company-wide updates, etc. I feel like I know what is going on with other teams and at a company level. Our exec team trusts us to the point of being able to share a lot of information (product development, financials, etc.) that might be kept confidential at other/larger companies.
- My lead gives me support and advice rather than micro-managing or delegating work to me... I essentially get to ""be my own boss"" on a day-to-day basis.

You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things.

Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building.

There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
 - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
 - A chance to make a huge difference
 - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
 - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
 - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain"," You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.","Stack ranking is a horrible practice since it's rife with favoritism. It's also not Amazonian in that it's not data based (arbitrarily designating a certain percentage of employees that must be put on performance management isn't a data driven criterion) and it's not frugal (effectively forcing an individual out of the company in one division who would make the grade in another is either retaining someone who doesn't meet the bar or a waste of talent). The goal is to force managers to actually make the hard decisions about how their team members compare with each other (not everyone can be exceptional), but it has more defects than virtues. Replace it with a common comparison of each person against the bar for their position, based on data. The percentages that are assigned to each performance category will turn out how they turn out, but there will be an evaluation mechanism that's fair and frugal.",4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,amazon

The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey. This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon. The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.","Bezos you bought the Washington Post and hired Jay Carney to be your PR head. There is nothing I can write here that you would deign listen to, because you are a hack.

For those grasping Weasels that have squirmed and back stabbed your way to success, you know who you are. You won't care what is written here because ""You got yours, Eff them.""

For those truly diligent and hard working employees that don't want to believe the story from NY times that called Amazon a ""Snake Pit"" because you don't want to think you actually are involved in such a dystopian landscape of anti-business ethics: ""Always yell with the crowd.

I started in Finance and although I was good at it, I did not enjoy it as much as I believed I should. I then pursued Program Management and later Product Management, where I found my passion. The great thing about Amazon is that internal transfers are not only expected, but encouraged. I personally move about every 3 years, but the duration one stays in a role greatly varies across the company. It's all about continuing to learn, feeling there is meaning in what you are doing, and finding things you are passionate about. Your time at Amazon will be what you make of it. I enjoy working with extremely intelligent people on a daily basis and the ability to take full ownership of my work. I should mention that I am a mother of two children and have great work-life balance.","The Day 1 culture at Amazon means many things, but one of them is solving new industry problems. If you are not comfortable with ambiguity and solving problems that have never been encountered before (to your knowledge), you may not enjoy working at Amazon. Depending on your role, I have heard that work-life balance can be more challenging for those starting early in their careers and looking to move up the ladder quickly. However, if you set expectations with your manager with open conversations about your desired flexibility, you will likely find an arrangement that works for you. Work-life balance is something you create for yourself as a priority, it is not automatically handed to you.","I've been fortunate to always have a great manager at Amazon, but I've seen others that do not. Your relationship with your manager will be a major factor in your enjoyment at work. IE: micro-managing vs empowerment, etc. For this reason, I'd encourage management to be open to feedback and reflect on your management style. Sometimes what you mistake for a weakness in your team's ability to deliver results could actually reflect a weakness in your management style. If you see high turnover in your team, perhaps take some time to reflect on your own actions rather than assuming they were 'not a good fit for the role.'",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,amazon

The hiring bar is extremely high, so everyone is extremely talented. Amazon VP's are some of the smartest people you will ever meet. The whole company moves so quickly that every day you are working on a new major initiative. The leadership principles are literally used everyday - people quote them in meetings, and the company only focuses on customers, never on competitors. It's quite remarkable. If you get an offer to work at Amazon, take it.","I stayed for over 6 years which put me above 98% of other Amazonians (there's a tool called ""oldfart"" that compares your tenure to other employees). Most people only last 2-3 years for several reasons. First, the pace is relentless which at first is exhilarating but becomes downright fatiguing. Second, Amazon doesn't really care about you as a person - only as a productive cog in the machine. Third, the RSU award program is ok, but total comp is really only great if the stock is climbing 30% a year. Finally, everyone wants to hire an ex-Amazonian right now. When you combine these, Amazon becomes an amazing training ground, but not a great place to stay long-term.","Amazon comp is decent, but many other top tier companies can match it with better benefits. PTO is weak and employee perks like discounts are non-existent. The 401(k) is limited and many other companies offer better stock vesting plans.

We went through an exhaustive effort to create a better publishing structure with milestones and gates, only to have it ignored 2 months after we started. After a few years here I felt drained of energy. The organization is so complex, getting anything approved or let alone finding who is in charge of a certain project is a tremendous task. And then when it all went south they hit the LAYOFF button. Laid off 200+ people...everyone except the management who actual made the awful decisions. We let go of some amazing talent that had long advocated against the decisions management was making. To add insult to injury I had to try and go around a beg for another job in the company - re-interviewing just like a new employee.

- HR also throws you “birthday parties.” 
- learned how to properly lift and use box cutter, which is extremely useful in real life
- you can use your time off anytime you want and they won’t question you about it.
- You have sick time, unpaid time, paid time off, and vacation time 
- set schedule
- benefits are great 
- perks are great! I got free tickets to a local water park and I believe you get discount for Verizon or some phone company too. They have discounts for pretty much everything. You just have to look it up. 
- they accept pretty much anyone. Didn’t go through an interview. 
- pay is good. $15 all around the nation is not bad. If you live near a big city, you get paid more. Got paid $15.70 since Seattle was next to us. 
- great career opportunities. Within working for a few months, they asked me if I wanted to be a learning ambassador, which is great start if you want to work your way up. Know a guy who became PA within just a few months as well

Honestly not a bad company. Worked here for a year. Left because my husband got stationed in Hawaii and there’s no amazon here unfortunately. That would’ve been awesome though"," long hours of heavy lifting back to back
- super sore coming home from every shift. Would not recover until two days into my weekend
- long hours. Show up to work when it’s still dark outside. By the end of your shift, it’s still dark. Come home, can’t really eat a big dinner or spend time with family because you need to go to bed right when you get home. Feels like your day is already wasted.

That was great because the resources and infrastructure of a big company were there, but it gave most people I worked with freedom to work on many projects, influence, move around, and contribute in many ways. Plus, many things moved faster than they might at other companies of the same size. Perks were really great including bonuses, events on the campus, opportunities, etc.","The biggest con is the annual layoff. During most of the years I was there, we were growing like crazy, beating expectations, gaining in stock price, etc. It was always positive and upward. However, every single January, it was known that there would be a round of layoffs, even when all numbers were looking great as they almost always were. Management called it restructuring. But, over the years, some really good people were let go for no apparent reason. Then to add insult to injury, a week or two later, there would be a company quarterly meeting discussing how VMware was doing so well and is still hiring, but they had to make some changes. It always felt dishonest and the sympathy for those let go came across as disingenuous.",January was always a nerve racking month and it completely destroyed any sense of loyalty to the company. I know a few people that completely changed their perception of VMware after a colleague of theirs was let go with no apparent rhyme or reason. Many people left shortly after as a result of losing loyalty to the company or for just being stressed out about themselves getting cut the next year.,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,vmware

612,Sun Sep 15 2019 13:47:47 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Principal Architect,"Palo Alto, CA",Former Employee ,Best place I have ever worked,I worked at VMware full-time for more than 5 years,11.0,"VMware is a much loved brand, with a massive community following in the industry. The premises (see what I did there) at Palo Alto HQ is a joyful place to work. There are several restaurants onsite, with coffee, ice cream, and every building has at least one kitchen stocked with soda, espresso machines, healthy and unhealthy snacks, peanut butter, bread, fruit, you name it. Over the years I have brought my family here to see the turtles, watch seasonal events that they throw, and even feed the turtles.

As for the technology, VMware have there staple diet of vSphere, but don't be fooled into thinking this is still just a virtualization company. With acquisitions such as Nicera that made NSX possible, and features such as vSAN, their staple diet is strong. Over recent years they have brought in some amazing talent, and the technical leadership is second to none. I'm talking about Chris Wolf, Joe Baguley, Bruce Davie, Christos Karamanolis, and Kit Colbert just to name a few.

What makes VMware successful today isn't just their core vSphere platform, but their ability to run it successfully in the public cloud (AWS, Google, Azure) and now bring in containers. I should also mention that in my day to day interactions with customers, other lesser known products such as vRealize Operations, Automation, Orchestrator, vCloud Director and Log Insight mean this is truly a world-class enterprise solution.

I know that many of you will be thinking I am talking like a 'fan boi', well maybe, but you must realize (pun intended) that this is the heart of what VMware is about. There is a real passion, especially among the technical engineering BUs, including the field (PSO, SE), for what VMware is about.

Pat Gelsinger was voted #1 CEO, and during my time there I had personally received emails from him in response to feedback I gave. There are not many other companies with over 22,000 employees that get this level of attention. He is also extremely committed to the community I was talking about. At VMworld this year (2019) he was at two community events in person, talking with both employees and customers.

During my time at VMware I worked in two countries, across 3 different business units, and what a ride.","Like any company there are some bad people, however I still hope this is the minority at VMware.

Unfortunately it was the actions of one particular individual which led me to leave the company. My successful trajectory came to a sudden stop due to this person. My manager.","Read my cons above. I actually took this particular issue to senior (VP level) leadership. While I felt supported and was offered an alternative team to work with, no action was taken on this person. Nothing at all. I didn't even know if (or how) there was a process to report this to HR without logging an internal ticket, and I feared he would see it.

Please look after your most talented staff, and watch for bad management. Remember, people don't leave companies, they leave managers.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,vmware

We get stuff done! I've only been here a few months, but they are very understanding of my career change and are helping me learn the ropes and the company as time goes by (even though they were very busy when I first started with many things going on, so I appreciate their help!). 

I get to work from home as much as I want and have yet to take any PTO, but the unlimited PTO option is pretty cool and I look forward to utilizing that in the future when I need to. Orientation was AWESOME, and I learned so many soft skills I didn't even realize I was lacking. This company really seems to care about culture and treating employees with respect. I look forward to using the skills they taught me to help the company in keeping to their high standards. 

It seems from other reviews that managers can make or break your time here. So far my managers and teammates have been nothing less than stellar and just so cool, so I feel my time here will continue to be a 5 star rating. I'm excited to keep learning and honing my skills and giving the best work possible.

The interview process for my position was grueling but honestly I feel in hindsight it was a pro. It really helped to encourage me that my skills were up to par with what they were looking for.","Orientation didn't happen until 3 months after I was hired. Felt very lost as to who and what VMware was exactly, and still am not entirely sure what the different softwares I'm working on are about (I don't come from a tech background). I've been told a few times but there's so many different ones, and new features constantly being added, and they can sound so complicated that it's hard to keep it all straight. I'm sure with time this will get easier though.",I feel there could definitely be a better on-boarding process for newbies. Maybe a packet that goes over everything more in depth that's related to that specific role?

Work/Life Balance, Upward Mobility, Cross Training or any career advancement is only existent if you have a manager and leadership team that will advocate on behalf of you and celebrate your accomplishments. Advocating on behalf of yourself only goes so far when BU management has their favorites.

EPIC Values is a joke and no one is actually held accountable to them. Vmware doesn't have a formal review process which is problematic because your manager is not obligated to communicate in a constructive way room for improvement/celebrate achievements. 

VMware has a LOT of work to do to actually give the representation they strive for outsiders to perceive. Lots of senior leaders that only employ people brought over from their previous companies with aged experience which ultimately stunts innovation and creativity. 

Younger employees are perceived as inexperienced and lacking knowledge. Someone has to either die or leave the company for you to be promoted. Sad because there are actual employees that are invested in the organization but don't have to the opportunity to innovate and make a change. And internal transfers are a joke - an external hire will be given the opportunity first, every time. 

So much for a ""career journey"" within the company. This is contributed to the fact that 90% of the recruiters at VMware are contractors and are not invested in the company and could care less about the candidate recruiting experience, even with an employee referral.

Excellent product portfolio.
Excellent CEO.

 Pat Gelsinger the CEO has done an awesome job of taking over the reigns of the company a few years ago and completely turning it around. The stock price has more than quadrupled under his leadership. He has acquired many startups and successfully integrated them into the VMWare product portfolio and eco system. Hats off to him for creating wealth for the employees, for the owners (EMC and now DELL) and for the investors. One of the finest CEO in the Silicon Valley.","Along with these product acquisitions, this company has also acquired managers and middle management who have no idea of what management is. There is no one culture at VMWare. There are as many cultures as the number of startups acquired and the managers of these startups are free to treat their teams as they want. HR is very weak in this company and they are not for you. They are for the managers ... dont rely on them. 

I had a short stint at one of these acquired startups called Velocloud. Incompetent management, very high attrition rate. Lot of senior engineers leaving the group. Those who stick around are there to vest their stocks. The founders thinks of themselves to be semi god who will punish you if you decide to leave their kingdom. Their technology stack will teach you nothing. Accept their offer if you cannot find a job somewhere else.

Most of these startup managers lack sympathy and empathy and will not hesitate to show you their powers and make you feel that you are a POS compared to them.

Dont be fooled by the ""100 Best Companies to Work"" or ""Top paying company"" marketing or the campus. It is actually an average paying and a very weak middle management company. Shop around, I am confident you will get a much better offer and a lot better culture, work environment and work life balance. I know people who were offered twice the package they were making at VMWare.",Pat: VMWare is doing an awesome job and will continue to do so under your excellent leadership.

My current boss does not respond to phone calls or emails, and no one is able to schedule meetings with her on a timely basis. When she does finally meet with us, she does 90% of the talking, most of which is merely a re-hash of what she knows about the situation but with no new insight or leadership provided. Essentially, she is all talk, and has developed a reputation among other executives as being uncooperative and just doing things on her own.

Finally, there is too much internal competition and politics where there should be teamwork and cooperation. People view it as a badge of honor if they do someone else's job, causing total chaos.

The company has a compelling story with VMC on AWS. Hopefully it delivers on that vision or else the company is in for some real tough times.","On-prem enterprise software is not a cool technology sector to be in. 

Because of this perception the company does not attract the best talent anymore. Most of the A level players have left from the engineering ranks to startups or the FANG companies. So co-workers are mediocre at best.

Also the company moves at a glacial pace, compared to all the companies working in the cloud - releases in VMware take months to a year. 

 Its anachronistic in this day and age to have a monolithic technology stack. But with such a large installed base it will be near impossible for the company to pivot. 

Due to all of the above constraints it is hard to get excited about the technology in the company. 

A lot of the upper management are from the traditional old companies like Cisco, HP and IBM. This does not inspire confidence in the middle management.

The company pays well on the salary and bonus front but the RSU's are significantly lower than what FANG pays. 

Bottom line VMware is no longer a premium destination for employees. Its more in the same league as a Cisco or Oracle. A tier 3 company at best.

Product management has the ability to directly comment and influence the careers of everyone in marketing yet marketing is given no ability to provide similar feedback on product management individuals in the review cycle. There is also very limited upward mobility in marketing, making working there a constant pressure cooker environment. That plus having to deal with a perpetual budgeting process makes marketing at Qualcomm a high-stress, low rewarding job. Because Qualcomm pays extremely well, it becomes extremely hard for anyone in marketing to challenge product management or take real control of the marketing process, which becomes dictated to marketing by product management. Marketing is, in effect, treated as a second class citizen within the org, and this is highlighted by the fact that the company has had a dozen different people managing marketing over the last decade. It's like the company doesn't really know what to do with the department which impacts the moral and enthusiasm of many of the people working there.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,qualcomm

They usually require 3 years in a position before promotion
Any slight rating drop in a performance review can push your promotion out a few years. Don't wait just get a new job and come back for a promotion.
If your tech manager is good you're fine. If they're horrible you're screwed get a new one immediately.

1235,Sat Nov 09 2019 18:15:55 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Senior Software Engineer,"Eagle, ID",Current Employee ,Boise Site (TSheets) - Great place to be,I have been working at Intuit full-time for more than 3 years,,"I was here before the acquisition and got to see the company change from a little Eagle ID startup to part of an 8,000+ employee corporation. Here are some thoughts from a software dev's perspective:

- The benefits got a lot better, you probably won't find any other jobs in Boise area that beat the benefits at Intuit. (Insurance, stock, bonus, etc,.)
- People you work with on a day to day are very smart.
- Intuit has some cool tech they're promoting internally for use across products.
- You get personal dev days at the end of each sprint and engineering days twice a year, which you can use to work on basically whatever you want, as long as you're improving yourself or the company in some way. (personal dev I usually spend learning new technologies I'm interested in by working on fun side projects.) If it weren't for personal dev I would've left the company years ago, it gives devs the ability to hone new skills instead of staying in their bubble."," TSheets lacks someone in the architect role so different development projects don't always come together nicely. Other intuit orgs have architect(s) who take on the job of forming a broader vision of how the codebase / architecture should work. 
 Seems like devs are always writing a lot of hacky stuff to make things work because of a lack of someone who has a bigger vision.
- Codebase will leave you wanting. I guess with a 12+ year old php monolith what are you going to do.. I will say it's getting better though.
- Management could prioritize code improvements more. Our feature teams don't have as high velocity as they could because of handicaps in our codebase.","Put someone in the architect role. Make that someone's full time job, it's seriously needed.

A while back there was talk about ""development sprints"".. or whatever we were calling it - a special sprint several times a year where devs could focus on cleaning up unused code, useful refactors, etc,. rather than feature work. That was talked about by the top dog JD at sprint retro and sounded official, then sort of never got spoken of again. From talking to devs around the org, those would seriously be useful even if it's just some teams here and there so please think about doing that.",4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,intuit

They provide amazing benefits and try to ensure the benefits are molded to the employee wants and needs. I have a positive work environment and still enjoy coming to work everyday because it has great people and the work I do makes me feel like I've made an impact so it's rewarding.,"It seems in the last year or so Intuit has been utilizing outsourcing agencies for our customer care. Although the intention is to provide jobs in areas that are struggling economically, it has hindered the amazing service we once provided and has caused a divide between Intuit agents and outsourced agents. These outsourced agents are not given the benefits and care that Intuit agents are given so they're not going to provide the amazing care that a happy employee would.

Internal jobs or career growth is not quite what it was. When I first started, Intuit was all about internal career opportunities and now it seems they look more externally. Career moves are not quite what they used to be. If a position is considered an entry level position then Intuit shouldn't be looking for someone who is more qualified. More opportunity should be given to agents that have dedicated their time to the business first rather than seeking externally.","Bring our care back in-house because happy employees means happy customers and in the long run that's more revenue for Intuit. Or work with the outsourced agencies to make sure our values are truly aligned and make sure their employees are truly happy. This is not insight that will be given right away, these outsourced agents need to feel like they can trust our people are there for them.

-Take care of your current employee's career growth before hiring outside. Entry level should be entry level. An 'Entry Level' Accountant position shouldn't have a ""preferred"" of a CPA certification. To become a CPA you have to have hands on experience under a CPA first. Bypassing employees that do not have this certification makes the job posting misleading and discouraging for future roles that may open up. CPA preferred shouldn't be on anything that is listed as entry level for a standard Accountant role.",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,intuit

First, the way they regard their employees is amazing. Having been in a sales role in several industries over my career, I have never seen a company so humble and interested in their employees. They genuinely care that you not only succeed, but work towards a goal that will make you happy.

Second, I know it’s cheesy but they let you be you. You are not molded into the model that they want in their company. They let you bring your strengths and your passions into work and direct you to use those for the good of company. 

They love innovation. I have had the opportunity within my first year to question processes and long held practices. With the support of my manager and director, I was supported the whole time. Never once was I made to feel that I should get in line, like many other companies. My ideas were judged on their merits and they welcomed the disruption to their practices. 

Finally, the benefits and opportunities to help your community are amazing. I have zero worries that whatever life throws at my family, Intuit will be standing behind me the entire time with all their resources.

Sure, people are imperfect and they don't always meet the high bar, but the expectation is that they'll do the work to get there. One unifying theme at Intuit is customer obsession -- all employees are highly focused on helping customers solve their financial problems (our company's mission is to Power Prosperity Around the World). It's easy to relate to our customers because we're all consumers with money concerns. We also cater to small businesses and the self-employed (a growing market because of the gig economy). Small businesses are the backbone of the economy, and I'm proud that although I work for a 9,000-person corporation, our focus is on the little guy. I never feel like I'm ""working for the man."" In fact, there's a larger than average number of women in leadership positions here. And we have a thriving program called ""Tech Women @ Intuit,"" with a team of four full-time employees who ensure that we attract, retain and promote technical women. Because of this and our family-friendly benefits and culture, I think Intuit is a top choice for technical women.

Another part of Intuit that resonates me is our ""We Care & Give Back"" program, which has shaped my approach to charitable giving. The company matches up to $5,000/year of employee donations, so my giving has double the impact. On top of that, Intuit pays for the annual gift I need to make because I sit on the board of a nonprofit. All employees get 32 hours of paid time to do charitable work. And what's most exciting is that the company has started creating ""Prosperity Hubs"" in economically struggling parts of the U.S., like in W. Virginia, where we train hundreds of people and give them jobs in the tech industry -- breaking their dependency on environmentally disastrous and dying industries like coal.

Lastly, the company recognizes the good work I do and pays me well. Over the years, my salary has paid for my daughter's college tuition (she has no student loan debt) and her wedding. I like the work I do, I've improved the lives of our employees, our customers and those in need, I've met great people and have made some lifelong friends, and my financial needs are covered. What more could you want from a company?","We have some challenges with internal tools, like our intranet.

Some bullet points are: Great benefits, invested in improving their employees, company culture isn't an afterthought. They're also actively working to bring modern tools and technology into the development stack allowing us to do some pretty cools things","Sadly while the culture is great, and the public facing technology is what you would expect from a modern SaaS company, the immediate tools they allow you to work with are not. It's fairly obvious the their IT organisation is pretty old school. While offering both Macs and PC's, the PC's are behemoths and not fun to carry around. They're so loaded with security software trying compensate for Window's poor security that you're lucky if the batteries last an hour sometimes. Sadly the Mac's aren't much better. Using a modern Linux distro isn't even allowed so you're stuck with 2 poor options for development environments. I often feel like the policies and infrastructure their IT org has put in place is actively trying to prevent me from getting my work done. 

Oh, I almost forgot to mention they've also installed keyloggers on their laptops. Nothing says you don't quite trust your employees like key loggers, ehh?","Intuit does everything else so well. It may seem small but I spend my entire day working on my laptop. These IT policies are put in place in a vacuum with no input from the people they are impacting day to day.

1502,Sun Apr 07 2019 08:00:27 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,Good company...but. Lack of Career Growth - Very Hierarchical - Excessive Micromanagement,I have been working at Intuit full-time,13.0,"Good benefits. Cutting edge - Innovative culture. Not satisfied with the status-quo but constantly striving to get better and better. They do walk the talk - “Integrity without Compromise”. Talented, driven people.","Internal opportunities are stagnant. In the years I have been with this company, I have seen time and time again where leadership would rather hire from outside the company than develop or cultivate development opportunities for internal employees. Because of this consistent behavior, upward mobility is very scarce within this company. To be certain, sometimes you need to bring in external talent to move things forward and address gaps, however, you also need to set your current employees up for success with targeted opportunities for development and a career path. The scale is tipped much further to the external hiring side at this company. Promotions to a director position are as rare as a Bigfoot sighting. You would have a better chance to get ahead (statistically) at this company by leaving, landing a higher position at a different company, and then trying to get hired back at Intuit at that same acquired level or higher. Seriously, if you do get hired here, plan to stay right where you are for a long, long time.

A very hierarchical culture by comparison to other companies I have worked for. Way too many hierarchical “roadblocks”. It seems childish (and it really is), but team managers and directors do not exactly like or encourage managers to communicate directly with executives if they are not involved directly with the communication. They want to be seen and heard when execs are involved. Very common for emails or presentations to be scrutinized many, many times over before being “allowed” to be sent or presented. Slows the communication process WAY down and creates a lot of extra work just to get communications out. No…this is not just “coaching” employees on effective executive communication. This behavior is prevalent and falls way outside of simple “coaching”. It’s sad, but the behavior shows a real lack of trust and results in a lot of wasted time due to excessive, un-needed micromanaging. I think if the executives could track the amount of time and effort that gets expended just to get communications to them from the “troops” they would immediately put a stop to this “roadblocking” behavior. It is no exaggeration to say that this bureaucratic back and forth consumes hours out of mine and my colleagues work week on a very regular basis. 

No doubt about it…Intuit goes through a very careful and extensive process to recruit and hire just the right candidates. They thoroughly vet candidates and form ""Assess for Awesome"" teams to ensure all candidates are very carefully reviewed and then selected. They pour a lot of time and effort into this process and then turn right around and micromanage the hell out of their people. It sounds ridiculous…and it really is. Intuit goes to great lengths to attract and bring in top talent…and then they simply don’t trust them to do the job they thoroughly vetted and hired them to do in the first place. I am constantly amazed at the amount of time directors and team leaders must have to be able to micromanage their staff all day. Long story short - lack of trust is a VERY big issue at Intuit. It is worse in some areas than others…but it exists throughout. It has gotten worse in the years I have been here.","Create more opportunities / upward mobility for the employees you currently have. Every time you hire for a senior position outside the company, ask yourselves why this candidate had to be external and what could we have done better to ensure the internal employees were being developed to grow into that position. 

You have a really solid hiring process…learn to trust the process and then learn to trust the people you hired to do their job. Lack of trust is felt throughout the “troops” and has created a lot of frustration. People here really feel devalued when they are not allowed to do the job you hired them to do without all of the “shoulder-surfing”. Employees here have some impressive credentials from the colleges they attended to the previous jobs they held. They worked hard to get here...and getting hired here at Intuit is not easy. Get out of their way and allow them to do what you hired them to do. The fact is, you may actually learn from your team if you provide them the opportunity to work with their own creativity and their own experience rather than constantly pushing them to ensure things get done in exactly the manner you would do it. Stick to establishing the high-level direction and goals with your teams and then stay out of weeds unless specifically asked. Your team members will feel more empowered in their jobs and have a better sense of job satisfaction when they know they are being relied on and trusted to drive their specific area.

Stop the childish behavior of creating hierarchical roadblocks. Allow your teams to be seen and heard by execs without all of the constant and time-consuming micromanaging. Your people will never develop the skills of solid, thoughtful, effective executive communication if you are always the one communicating for them. 
One of your main responsibilities as a team leader is to provide your people with the tools and experiences they will need to grow and succeed. Don't lose sight of how important this aspect of being a team leader is. Put your team first - it is not all about you. Trust in the fact that the success and overall happiness of the team will reflect on you and your abilities to lead. No doubt, a team that feels dejected and devalued will reflect on you and your abilities as well.",3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,intuit

It's no Google, but it's solid in this regard.

There are engaging events for engineers from time to time, such as tech talks and ""engineering days"", where you focus on something unrelated to your work that you're passionate about. It's refreshing to have the chance to develop your skillset while improving the product.

For the most part, very approachable and down to earth management hierarchy. Transparency is one of the things I like the most and greatly appreciate knowing how the team/business is doing and what things we do well and what needs to be improved on.

Opportunity for advancement is certainly available as long as you can navigate the politics well, which I suppose leads me into the ""Cons"" section...","This place reeks of tenured employees that stifle innovation and resist change for the sake of simplicity every chance they get. Big egos with subpar engineering backgrounds pollute the codebase with terrible architectural patterns that get replicated by fledgling developers. This also causes issues with team dynamics, as the louder voices in the room tend to hinder a productive work environment. The resulting toxic culture (and rampancy of politics) is unfortunately my biggest issue with working here.

Organizational structure rotates regularly, so often times your ""mission"" or role is unclear. I've had 3 managers already in my time here, and is sad to spend all that time developing rapport only to have to start over again. 

Mobile is definitely an afterthought but trending in the right direction. A lot of architectural patterns and organizational projects skew toward a more web/backend focused effort. 
 
Compensation is also a frustration point, specifically RSU grants. Quite frankly, they're pathetic given how well the company is doing, and far under what major tech players are paying. If you want your company to be respected in the tech industry, you have to pay your talented engineers well. 
There's also a large disparity between the rating system and comp -- two staff engineers with an identical rating could have RSU amounts that differ wildly enough to bring suspicion of favoritism to the table. I've heard they're working on this though.","De-power the ""problem children"" that are stifling both product innovation and personal growth of the team. Stop changing team structure every 3 months.

Tax DIY is a dying business since many competitors are offering DIY tax prep software for free. Though Intuit tries hard to be a software company, it is not entirely a software company.

You shouldn’t consider Bloomberg News as a mid-career journalist. If you’re age 40 or older, don’t even bother applying. You probably won't even land an interview, let alone get hired.

Admin/Customer Service disguised as ""Analyst"" Job.

Claim to be a tech company but relies heavily on Excel. If Microsoft takes out Excel, Bloomberg will shut down along with the world market that relies on Bloomberg data.

Not a finance job but a financial product ambassador; people do modelling and financial analysis but it is just to make ""clients"" have ease of use and show more functionality for the terminal. Analyst/Analytics here is synonymous to knowing what the client/customer needs and not necessarily include any quantitative analysis. Might be less than 5% that quantitative analysis will be required for an Analyst job.","Check your people's qualifications.

It used to be a great company that looked after its employees, but over last 2 years they have been looking to get rid of anyone with a decent salary and tenure. Have been replacing with kids out of college at a fraction of the salary and zero experience then working them to death, turnover is staggering with very high numbers of new recruits leaving within the first 2 years. Sales managers have almost no experience of selling and are promoted only for their micro management prowess. 

Sales targets are ridiculous and they count net performance, that means that salesperson takes a hit for any removals, but gets NO credit for renewals. Sales is blamed for every removal even though product teams have not developed a decent product in almost a decade, and are obsessed with growing revenue even though there is no new product/service to help in the growth. So their strategy has been to double/triple/quadruple prices for existing services which makes it extremely difficult to have any new sales discussion with this clients, then blame is laid upon the sales force for not hitting ridiculous targets.",Come down from your ivory towers and experience a day in the life of your employees or better yet speak to one of your customers before you reach your ridiculous business decisions.,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,bloomberg

""CALL ME""
""My launchpad is broken""
""Can you confirm the IPO date 943819 US Equity was on 9/8/2017?""

However, it's truly the management that lack of empathy that creates an environment that makes the desk an inky black hole where every molecule of light/joy cannot escape. A few examples include:
-Time off has to be asked 120 days in advance no matter the situation during the holidays/summer
-No breaks (including the bathroom) are to be given if the queue is busy
-Genuine disregard for the emotions, aspirations, and general well being of employees.

You'll be expected to dedicate yourself and your life to Michael Bloomberg and his philanthropic ventures. There's no such thing as work-life balance at Bloomberg, just work-work. While you may be scheduled to work 9 hour days (don't even think about taking a lunch break) it's more likely you'll be working 10 hour days and 11 and 12 hour days are not uncommon. For all that hard work and effort you'll be rewarded with zero job security. Loyalty is very much a one-way street at Bloomberg and layoffs are routine. Your future is solely dependent on your manager, and they change often. My first 6 reviews at Bloomberg were written by 6 different bosses. If you get one that takes a dislike to you, regardless of your performance, you're toast. I've seen hard-working, talented employees get the boot while workers who literally spend the day on their Facebook page, texting and take 2 hour lunches keep their jobs.

There is a segment of the company that is genuinely interested in leveraging cutting edge technology and making an impact. However, there is an equally large segment of the company that is reluctant to relinquish the practices they’ve been using since the mid 90s. For example, many teams use relatively modern python; but there were times where I encountered teams with no interest with updating their Linux incompatible C++93. The company has largely stagnated between these opposing factions.

There’s also a mediocre to at times hostile work environment for engineers belonging to underrepresented groups. The workforce is largely male and there are almost no engineers from ethnically underrepresented groups. This can create a lonely environment as the undiverse management doesn’t seem interested in going beyond lip service.","Hire more diverse managers and make an actionable commitment to improving the workplace, technically and otherwise.",3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,bloomberg

1586,Tue Aug 27 2019 13:29:11 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Journalist,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Bloomberg News.....The Gilead of the media world..,I worked at Bloomberg L.P. full-time for more than 8 years,3.0,The quiet editors deemed unfashionable whose ability to take copy that is akin to scribble and turn it into something legible are the unsung heroes of that place. Sadly the scribblers tend to be promoted.,"* Micromanagement on steroids. Cameras everywhere, key strokes monitored and the time you are in the office is also measured. Make no mistake if you are one minute late expect to get an email.

* BULLYING CULTURE....it is sad to watch people who are elevated to management embrace the culture and start sending emails to people who were once friends about Bloomberg standards (which are Gilead like), social media responsibility (apply self censorship muzzle here) and writing news stories that resemble bullet points so as to keep your metrics up.

* On social media, the transgressions from personal twitter accounts were so trivial that most either stopped using social media or found alternate employment.

* SHOUTING AT STAFF IS GOOD...APPARENTLY? !!!!! Any organisation where screaming at subordinates is considered standard is one that will result in the victim seeking some form of medication, treatment, and having their self worth destroyed.....or they embrace the same behavior. Bloomberg is full of bullying managers who cannot leave their staff alone to do their jobs....constant hectoring and poor processes only compound the problem.

* POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AT A LEVEL APPROACHING MADNESS - Mike Bloomberg's weird personal views on workplace loyalty, climate change and a decent society is where the organization shaped in his likeness reaches rank hypocrisy. Despite the wacky obsession about sugary drinks in New York, the wall of sugar at the company's hideous neon offices are a reminder to never leave and drink soda for 12 hours (sorry, 14 hours a day).

* Bloomberg LP has been sued many times for being hostile to women, especially pregnant women. Despite the PR about how the company has embraced flexibility, such pieces are complete fiction and do not tell the real story of what happens when many women return from maternity leave. Feel free to read the NY Times to get the company view on females who dare to have a baby. 'Mayor Shows His Testy Side in Deposition for a Lawsuit' on April 14, 2011.'

* CLIMATE CHANGE HYPOCRISY - Bloomberg LP relies on terminal sales to many industries and takes money from BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore, Whitehaven Coal....wait! yes coal companies whom Mike Bloomberg wants to shut down. (Mike is annoyed that people are apathetic about the approaching apocalypse but like children who rebel against religious parents it is simply a case of normal folk rebelling against having an issue shoved down their throat by billionaires. Nothing gets a Bloomberg editor giddy around the loins like the image of Hollywood stars flying in private jets to exclusive resorts to give lectures on climate and consumerism. It is amazing the air time given to people who wear spandex and pose in front of green screens for a living. 

* Like Gilead, Bloomberg has an army of Editors at Large (commanders)......this is code for former Team Leaders and Bureau Chiefs who have been kept on to write 2000 word op-eds no one reads and to hold forth in strategy sessions about what politics mean for a given country. The Sydney bureau is blessed with several Commanders in these roles as its leadership wrestles with the most gripping issue facing the island nation........Australia's misogyny problem. Month after month, the Sydney bureau's self-flagellation results in snore fests of how to get women into management positions......forget the economy, this is where the real new stories are at! (it was amazing to learn that outside the Bloomberg offices, there are men walking down the road holding their wife or girlfriend's hand.......there is hope for Australia yet).

* Not to be outdone, the London bureau have a cool social club....the LGBTQI_Women_Climate_Change_More_Women_in_Leadership_Diversity Social Club.....sadly I didn't get to join this social club.....

The CEO is amazing and some awesome colleagues. Plenty of young colleagues (if you're younger and starting out). Volunteering activities are great. Company is serious about philanthropy.,"Global Data is a joke and a revolving door for college grads. They make you go through a fairly lengthy interview process, but the full-time role is a joke. Trust me when I say that you're not doing anything finance related. You're in a back-office role doing manual data entry which can be automated at any time. In fact, Bloomberg is pushing for automation so I wouldn't be surprised to see Global Data dissolved. Also it really matters which team you land on. No matter what, STAY AWAY from fixed income. Specifically the mortgages team and to some extent bonds. You'll be going through all the same issues as everyone else in Global Data but with A LOT more work than your non-fixed income colleagues. Besides Global Data being a joke, be prepared to face A LOT of politics. There's politics all over the place. Since there's so many fresh college grads, it feels like college with college drama. ""Senior leaders"" are outdated. Some have been with the company for several decades simply because of their connections. In fact, since there's so many people for so few TL spots, the only way to move up is to be friends with management. You get ""unlimited sick days"" but no one takes them because there's a stigma. If you do end up taking one, if it's Friday or Monday, be ready to face judgement when you're back. Work from home is also so so hard to get. It's pretty basic these for companies to offer this, but the company doesn't want to set a standard of working from home daily. Thus, managers are encouraged to not let their teams work from home. As for career prospects after, there's very little. Poor at best. Think about it, you're not doing finance so no banks want you. Since you're doing data entry all day, you're not developing technical or finance skills. Also you're working with Bloomberg systems which isn't applicable to other companies. If you were working with SAP, Qlik, Tableau then that would actually be useful but you're not. Lastly, the location sucks. You're not in Princeton, you're in freaking- Skillman, New Jersey.

Once you start off as a ""financial analytics"" representative they provide you with training which makes you feel like you're learning a lot about finance. In reality they are only teaching you how to use the Bloomberg terminal which is an outdated piece of software from the 80s with an offensive user interface. The name ""financial analytics"" representative really stands for customer service representative. You work at the help desk. Your entire day is answering tons customer service ""tickets"" that come into the help desk. There is nothing analytical or financial about this position. When a financial professional comes into the help desk Its your job to search the terminal (most of the time literally searching in the search bar) to find whatever number or news story they are looking for. All you do for 8/9 hours a day is answer help desk questions for clients who 90% of the time are rude and in a hurry for the answer because they value their time much more than yours. 

Here is where the ""toxic"" work culture comes from. Every morning that you log in you have a dashboard of your 10+ metrics which are constantly being compared to your coworkers. if your numbers are even percentage lower than your ""peer average"" prepare to be constantly reminded by your managers to get your customer satisfaction numbers up. Coworkers check each others dashboards to make sure their metrics are better to avoid being in the bottom 10%. Management takes that bottom 10% and will put them on a performance plan and even threaten to terminate their employment. Management uses manipulative tactics to make sure their employees are solving as many ""tickets"" as humanly possible, like you are a robot. 

I understand a job can be stressful, I understand that as an employee you are required to perform for the company. But I have never seen a company where people come in and leave with a constant feeling of anxiety that they need to out perform their peers and stretch themselves to a limit to hit metrics. This is not a sales, finance, or analytical job. This is a over the top and extremely stressful customer service job.",If you want robots working at the help desk then invest in AI and have actual robots answer customer questions. Don't use manipulation to get employees to hit their metrics. Listen to your employees and learn why they may feel stressed and support them. They are more than numbers on a dash board and work tirelessly to answer all client questions. This job is not an easy one and it would help if you actually tried to give support instead of staring at our metrics all day and jumping on us when you see a change.

Editorial folks' comp is good vs. what else is out there, and why many never want to leave.","But there's a rule for everything at Bloomberg that's paralyzing and has highly competent, intelligent professionals constantly feeling the need to seek affirmation of a half dozen leaders/authorities before acting. In my role, for instance, I've got 4-5 people to manage but 5-6 bosses. It's a much different vibe than anywhere I've been. Also say ""adios"" to your personal time. If you commute, expect a 12-14 hour day. Bloomberg has finally evolved with the times a bit by allowing people to telecommute here and there, but each day is drudgery. Instead of fixing a simply typo of a company name, for instance, the offender deals with a belabored, almost embarrassing process of having to re-run a story with the correction, deleting the old one off the system, then writing a letter to several managers to detail exactly what went wrong; so God forbid you spell it Proctor & Gamble instead of Procter & Gamble -- total rabbit hole that eats up tons of time and distracts. This is where Bloomberg takes its mantra of being candid to unproductive extremes and creates a sense of arrogance among the higher-ups that what Bloomberg does is above the level of its rivals. It's utter nonsense, as is the sense that employees can be rated based on cockeyed data points focused on production levels rather than quality of the work.","Ditch all data sets behind employee rankings and eliminate the micromanagement that's crippling to experienced professionals. Reduce the workday to something more manageable instead of burning out your employees with sweatshop hours. And if you're going to give away tons of the company's profit to charities, at least give each employee the option to designate their own organization.

1665,Mon Feb 04 2019 18:13:22 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Analyst,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Diversity and Inclusion — What a Joke!,I have been working at Bloomberg L.P. full-time for more than 5 years,22.0,There is free food and snacks consistently at your disposal. The organization is big on volunteering and philanthropic endeavors so working here will afford you the opportunity to make an impact on other people’s lives outside of the company. That’s the full extent of the benefits in my opinion.,"Now here are the cons:

First, take heed to many of the comments written about managers. Many managers currently in place have moved up the pipeline through connections or likability - not through grit or hard work. In addition, your initial manager will define your success or failure before you step foot in the door so my advice, make sure to do some vetting before you accept an offer here. 

Second, while the company is great at tackling challenges outside of the organization, there is a significant amount of work to be done on diversity and inclusion front. Let me explain: If you are a cis White male, you will have countless opportunities at your disposal even if you lack the education, experience or credentials. Leadership within the organization is akin to a fraternity where you’re accepted based on whether you’re liked by management and not by how hard you work. 

This moves me to my next point - women and minorities in leadership. Of the 19k+ employees worldwide, Black employees make up less than 3.8% of the workforce. Latino demographics are slightly higher perhaps by a base point or two. Asians account for roughly 7-8% I believe. 

While you will see minorities scattered throughout the organization, the reality that few of them achieve leadership success within the organization is certainly true. For women of color, especially Black women of color, the harsh reality is even fewer achieve leadership success despite many of them having stellar performance reviews and tenured experience. 

Retention for women and minorities is even more of a joke. Countless number of women and minorities are leaving the company because of the cis white male hegemony present within the organization.","Do yourself a favor - proactively recruit and retain more women and people of color. Provide more opportunities to those who do not fit the majority mold yet who consistently provide quality work. 

Stop promoting solely on the basis of whether or not you like someone and focus on who can bring true value and impact to your organization.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,bloomberg

BB pays very well. This is the first company I've been at that actually makes good on their promise of a bonus as well. It's very stable here. This is NOT a hire / fire culture. They vet for the best and make every effort to make you successful in the company. If a team dissolves, they will work with you to find a new team - at least for engineers. The work from home capabilities are decent. You can wear whatever you want. Literally. Before I joined I thought BB was a stiff-necked cross between a bank and hedge fund. Nope. I was happily mistaken. They have fresh fruit, free soup, tons of coffee, and snacks for free - daily. Oh, and every office is littered with tons of exotic salt & fresh water tanks. Like, they're everywhere. It's beautiful.","Not the most interesting work for web devs. The company is primarily based on the Terminal (C++ stuff with a UI literally from 1985), although I don't work on that.

- Though organization chart looks very flat for entry level analyst, people with different skills can propose and work on totally different projects that make best use of their skills
- There are three streams of speciality /skills that are looked upon in this role. First type of people are ""good"" at tech: which is anonymous to VBA (shifting to python gradually), SQL , R and statistical analysis etc. The second type ""knows"" the market and collaborates with some other departments internally to publish data driven news articles. Third type are more finance or business driven, who helps with the top line and client engagement pre or post sale.","Cons are mainly for the role itself.
- Hiring is not role specific for fresh/recent graduates to the entry level analyst position. Under the same umbrella of the global data department, the nature of work can be quite different for different teams. However, this assignment was not made known to the new hires until their first day or even later.
- Most of the daily work is based on the Bloomberg terminal and some internal softwares and highly repetitive, which makes the knowledge of knowing a lot of nuances and judgement of knowing what data is wrong/correct not transferable to the next job
- The role should be best described as ""Data operations analyst"" or ""Data management analyst"" ( not ""Global Data Analyst"" or ""Market Analyst"" as that does not reflect the nature of the responsibilities). As such, I do not see a long-term fit of any of the above 3 types of people if they are ambitious in further developing their (emphasis: transferable) skills through work experience.
- A lot of so-called projects are exact duplicates, but people in different regions just keep on working on their localized ""projects"" even if it has already been done elsewhere.

1713,Wed Oct 31 2018 11:52:01 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),,,Current Employee ,"Bloomberg Intelligence: Great team, great product (but not for sheep)",I have been working at Bloomberg L.P. full-time,6.0,"I’ve worked at Bloomberg Intelligence long enough to know the future here is far brighter than stuck in a broken bulge-bracket boiler room (do you remember the heyday - when the buyside trusted their views, Associates loved their jobs and Analysts didn’t live layoff-to-layoff? Then you are alone...). Like most of my senior colleagues, I was a successful Analyst at a traditional research shop you‘d know. Here I have more client access, more access to companies and experts, and more resources to build my franchise. It would take a true lack of vision to ever go back.

I decided to write this after reading several narrow-minded nuggets, lobbed into this forum by some grumpy elves (so scarce at BI, most of us can guess who). I hope I can offer some balance, and not sound promotional because, frankly, working here is pretty good. I’ve taken enough interviews to know I have good options, and seen a few peers leave for seats they really wanted. To me, BI is the best place to be.

I’d also like to counter some of the unfair baloney leveled at management. I’m not a manager, but their fairness and vision is a key reason that I joined and that I stay. Know any “leaders” you’d follow among those still squeezing pennies out of sellside sweatshops? Ours have the honesty to see the legacy biases, vision to shape a novel product, and guts to get started.

The BI product is fun to write and powerful to read because a generalist can quickly engage it, an expert can dive deep, it is soaked in data and it is modular in a way that brings the right analyst’s voice into the right part of any report. Imagine writing a detailed research piece, but knowing your peers would link your best paragraphs right into their own work – and that you’d better recheck it often, because the graphs are live!

As an Associate, the pieces we author on industry basic concepts and indicators will be yours to write sooner than anywhere else. You’ll build company models experienced buysiders use to actually make decisions (not ones designed to play the “call me, I’m far out of consensus!” game)

You’ll also battle a bunch of weird new technology systems, and always wonder that the “rules” are! Why? Because, this is NOT an ancient financial house where a bunch of well-connected jerks rig rules to make sure you can’t get your full bonus or take their cushy job. This IS a (well-funded) startup, where quickly making anything new or cool clients want comes before designing a clear, simple career path for you and us. But, as always in life, uncertainty comes with benefits.

As an Associate, us Analysts will actually teach you to pick up coverage. We are growing, we have a lot more to cover and we don’t have to defend ourselves against your career progress! Oh, and we’ll let you have time to have a life at the end of the day. Oh, and you’ll actually make some friends, because it isn’t “you or them” in the next round of inevitable layoffs (see history of “real research” shops). Oh, and the top-to-bottom pay disparity here is FAR narrower than any I’ve seen on the street. Oh, and you’ll get to work at Bloomberg – where people are much happier overall than most places.

As an Analyst, you either already see why this is a great place – or not. In the latter case I’d probably respect you, but not want to work with you. I came here for novelty and innovation and to be with colleagues who were also uninspired by the bare-knuckles battle down the old-school path. Frankly, I’ve been paid well enough that I’m still glad I took the risk. Best of luck with MiFID 2!","It's tough to balance the stable research product clients expect, against the fast technology change expected within an innovator like Bloomberg.

Most senior devs have been in the company since college and haven’t learned anything new about the world of coding for years. It is tough when your team lead is both a friendly person but also hasn’t heard of basic coding tools, like `curl`.

I have friends who entered the company with me just a year or so ago out of college and spend most of their time writing fortran. (If you don’t know what fortran is, and you’re under 40, that’s probably a good thing.) Bloomberg Terminal frontend apps are written in an esoteric javascript framework called Rapid, which is a major headache and won’t help you build skills in any modern frontend framework.

Bloomberg is a good first job out of college in that you get a great pay and great benefits and can use that to establish yourself in a new city (probably nyc) and save up some money / pay off loans.

The turnover is incredibly high and the reasons for these have been stated lengthily in the other reviews. 
Probably about 75% of the data teams are complete BS. Most of your job will be manually tagging data day in and day out cranking out work items. Then you will be assigned a block of time where you have to do troubleshooting for clients and their questions. Nobody can escape this, everyone who is an analyst has to do this. It can be manageable if you are on a big team where you might be assigned to do this once a week for a few hours to doing it multiple hours a day. The actual ""data analysis"" works probably comprises of a small part of your day unless you are an extremely motivated individual who stays in the office for an extra 10 hours a week to do these projects on your own. 

It is crucial that you find contacts within global data that can give you an honest picture of the data team that you get the offer for. There are some very good teams that are working on exciting projects under talented managers and if you get onto those teams then this should be an auto accept. 

One of the other things is that it is an unfortunate cycle where the talented folks quickly learn that they either got stiffed by a bad team/manager, or reached a professional/educational growth ceiling in their role. Since the management structure is extremely flat, these folks leave within 1-3 years. Because of this, the middle of the road analysts stay and end up becoming horrible managers. There are of course some amazing managers, but this is the exception not the rule.","You have this amazing company that gives an incredible amount of pay and benefits but you have this horrible turnover and you ask yourself why?

A very small number of talented and ambitious individuals in the division who are willing to work hard and create value for clients, but unfortunately they are ignored and demonized for any attempt to question the direction of the division and conduct insightful research. They deserve better.","This is a review I found on glassdoor that i felt ENTIRELY represents the reality of BI, and so I felt it was more than appropriate to quote it here. I URGE you to read this in its entirety if you are thinking about joining BI:

""The owner of Bloomberg L.P. famously said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention: “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!” ….sadly there is a con job going on within his business, right under his nose, within his Bloomberg Intelligence department (internally referred to as BI, externally by clients as BS) and he appears to be completely oblivious to it...

The Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) mission, sadly, seems to be destroying the hard earned reputation of Bloomberg L.P.’s owner and Analysts/Associates who work for the department through the combination of sheer management incompetence and deceitful practices.

How is BI Management accomplishing this mission?

Bloomberg Intelligence writes BITs (Bloomberg Industry Thoughts) or commonly referred to internally by everyone in the department as “SPAM”. Each BIT is about 2 tweets long (~500 characters)…these BITs are strung together to create the Wall Street's shallowest and most backward looking “research” product, the quality of which is multiples worst than Seeking Alpha and not even remotely comparable to traditional sell-side research.

Two primary products are produced: Primers (reworded investor presentations which are portrayed as insight) and ‘Best’ Ideas (any old semi-coherent, half-baked, or ill-formed notion). An Analyst’s research quality is judged solely based on their initial compensation level (not the actual research they produce) and pay bands are extremely wide ($125K to $800K per year for nearly identical roles). BI Management refers to this pay scheme as a meritocracy, but it is literally the diametric opposite. This logic ensures that where you begin in terms of compensation within BI is where you end -- irrespective of the quality of research produced. This practice ensures mediocre research is the norm and persists because there is zero incentive to produce high quality work.

The highest compensated Analysts in the department have Associates, recent college graduates who write BITs and work on their behalf. Given that the quality of the 'research' does not matter, this setup enables the highest paid analysts to do very little, if any, analytical work and effectively arbitrage of the wide pay differentials between Analysts and Associates (who earn less than $125K per year). Bloomberg L.P. is paying some Analysts $600K+ while they outsource the vast majority of the work to recent college graduates. BI Management refers to this practice as a ""perk"" of seniority, which decoded means that so long as you don't blow the whistle on them - they are happy to let some Analysts not earn their compensation. In fact, what BI Management is effectively doing is buying the silence of their most senior Analysts.

There is a quota for BITs that must be produced (20+ weekly), which primarily consist of Primers (20+ companies, 10 BITs minimum each, refreshed quarterly), Best Ideas (2 monthly, about 6 bits each), and other random pieces of information (the plug). This framework created by BI Management creates a never-ending treadmill of low value BITs/”research” that clients don’t find useful. This is evidenced by the lack of traction and engagement with clients despite having the best distribution system on Wall Street - the Bloomberg Terminal. Analysts are routinely encouraged to put in fake PROs notes (the internal system to track client engagement) to hide this fact - a simple review of what merits a PROs note for BI would uncover this. Just compare a Sales PROs note to one produced by BI to see first hand the level of deception.

BI’s key internal metric is “hits” (research views, not research quality) and this metric is routinely gamed by BI Management. The primary means of gaming the metric are through “clickbait” headlines and counting a BIT as a “hit” even if a client spends literally only 2 seconds on it. In other words, if a client clicks on a headline and then immediately exits the BIT, BI considers this “client engagement” -- this is the vast majority of research views/hits. The combination of these business practices enables BI Management to show they are taking share on the Terminal by creating increasing amounts of spam largely at the expense of the legitimate news department and in the process make the Terminal less useful. Clients are so revolted by BI that they regularly ask Sales how to block BI's content.

In addition to BIT writing, Analysts are also expected to serve as pundits on TV, present at conferences, develop deep relationships with counterparts at covered companies, as well as speak to and visit with clients. Given the extreme low quality of the product produced by the BIT treadmill, companies and clients largely ignore BI because they do not consider the department a credible research provider. BI Analysts only speak at 4th Tier conferences...the ones who frankly can’t get anyone else. Truth be told, most clients think BI Analysts are reporters. BI’s management then represents to the Board of Directors that BI is comparable to Top Tier sell-side shops like JP Morgan….this notion is beyond laughable. Bloomberg Intelligence is provided free to terminal clients and clients are getting what they paid for.

Analysts and Associates are leaving BI in droves even if it means taking a step backwards in their careers and accepting lower pay - this fact alone tells you all you need to know about the department. Turnover in the department is in excess of 25%. BI Management spins this number to the Board of Directors and HR by telling them falsehoods, namely that as BI’s profile increases Analyst and Associates are getting “picked off” by the Street. This is a straight up lie and highlights the character and integrity of BI Management. People are voting with their feet and the turnover rate is reflective of the complete lack of confidence BI management and the product they have created.

BI Management’s primary business strategy is ‘putting lipstick on a pig’. Given the extremely low quality of the product BI’s management have created, this approach is logical. Helping execute this strategy are Directors of Research and Team Leaders. Their aim is to strong arm subordinates into submission like the prison guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment. The qualities required to be a Director of Research or Team Leader are straightforward -- lack of research ability and empathy for the people they lead and most importantly a willingness to continue BI Managements organizational deceit without any questions. In short, these are people who lack a back-bone and enable Bloomberg LP to continue being conned….and for this, they are richly compensated by BI Management. Management is aware that Directors of Research and Team Leaders are unemployable outside of BI...and effectively pay them to perpetuate the scheme...

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that Bloomberg can not solve the problems in its Intelligence department with the same level of thinking that created them. Most in the department expect Bloomberg’s Board of Directors to eventually axe BI’s entire management team if not the whole department when they figure out the reputational damage BI has caused.

The owner of Bloomberg L.P. and potential 2020 presidential candidate has proclaimed “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!”...So long as BI persists in its current form, sadly this statement should be viewed as false.""","Advice to the owner of Bloomberg L.P. and the Board of Directors....first fire BI management...then answer the question ""How was this organizational deceit allowed to occur for so long?""",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,bloomberg

1749,Fri Sep 28 2018 13:41:04 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Analyst,,Current Employee ,Bloomberg Intelligence Equals Reputation Risk & Organizational Deceit,I have been working at Bloomberg L.P. full-time,20.0,Free food and healthcare plan,"The owner of Bloomberg L.P. famously said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention: “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!” ….sadly there is a con job going on within his business, right under his nose, within his Bloomberg Intelligence department (internally referred to as BI, externally by clients as BS) and he appears to be completely oblivious to it...

The Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) mission, sadly, seems to be destroying the hard earned reputation of Bloomberg L.P.’s owner and Analysts/Associates who work for the department through the combination of sheer management incompetence and deceitful practices.

How is BI Management accomplishing this mission? 

Bloomberg Intelligence writes BITs (Bloomberg Industry Thoughts) or commonly referred to internally by everyone in the department as “SPAM”. Each BIT is about 2 tweets long (~500 characters)…these BITs are strung together to create the Wall Street's shallowest and most backward looking “research” product, the quality of which is multiples worst than Seeking Alpha and not even remotely comparable to traditional sell-side research.

Two primary products are produced: Primers (reworded investor presentations which are portrayed as insight) and ‘Best’ Ideas (any old semi-coherent, half-baked, or ill-formed notion). An Analyst’s research quality is judged solely based on their initial compensation level (not the actual research they produce) and pay bands are extremely wide ($125K to $800K per year for nearly identical roles). BI Management refers to this pay scheme as a meritocracy, but it is literally the diametric opposite. This logic ensures that where you begin in terms of compensation within BI is where you end -- irrespective of the quality of research produced. This practice ensures mediocre research is the norm and persists because there is zero incentive to produce high quality work. 

The highest compensated Analysts in the department have Associates, recent college graduates who write BITs and work on their behalf. Given that the quality of the 'research' does not matter, this setup enables the highest paid analysts to do very little, if any, analytical work and effectively arbitrage of the wide pay differentials between Analysts and Associates (who earn less than $125K per year). Bloomberg L.P. is paying some Analysts $600K+ while they outsource the vast majority of the work to recent college graduates. BI Management refers to this practice as a ""perk"" of seniority, which decoded means that so long as you don't blow the whistle on them - they are happy to let some Analysts not earn their compensation. In fact, what BI Management is effectively doing is buying the silence of their most senior Analysts.

There is a quota for BITs that must be produced (20+ weekly), which primarily consist of Primers (20+ companies, 10 BITs minimum each, refreshed quarterly), Best Ideas (2 monthly, about 6 bits each), and other random pieces of information (the plug). This framework created by BI Management creates a never-ending treadmill of low value BITs/”research” that clients don’t find useful. This is evidenced by the lack of traction and engagement with clients despite having the best distribution system on Wall Street - the Bloomberg Terminal. Analysts are routinely encouraged to put in fake PROs notes (the internal system to track client engagement) to hide this fact - a simple review of what merits a PROs note for BI would uncover this. Just compare a Sales PROs note to one produced by BI to see first hand the level of deception.

BI’s key internal metric is “hits” (research views, not research quality) and this metric is routinely gamed by BI Management. The primary means of gaming the metric are through “clickbait” headlines and counting a BIT as a “hit” even if a client spends literally only 2 seconds on it. In other words, if a client clicks on a headline and then immediately exits the BIT, BI considers this “client engagement” -- this is the vast majority of research views/hits. The combination of these business practices enables BI Management to show they are taking share on the Terminal by creating increasing amounts of spam largely at the expense of the legitimate news department and in the process make the Terminal less useful. Clients are so revolted by BI that they regularly ask Sales how to block BI's content.

In addition to BIT writing, Analysts are also expected to serve as pundits on TV, present at conferences, develop deep relationships with counterparts at covered companies, as well as speak to and visit with clients. Given the extreme low quality of the product produced by the BIT treadmill, companies and clients largely ignore BI because they do not consider the department a credible research provider. BI Analysts only speak at 4th Tier conferences...the ones who frankly can’t get anyone else. Truth be told, most clients think BI Analysts are reporters. BI’s management then represents to the Board of Directors that BI is comparable to Top Tier sell-side shops like JP Morgan….this notion is beyond laughable. Bloomberg Intelligence is provided free to terminal clients and clients are getting what they paid for. 

Analysts and Associates are leaving BI in droves even if it means taking a step backwards in their careers and accepting lower pay - this fact alone tells you all you need to know about the department. Turnover in the department is in excess of 25%. BI Management spins this number to the Board of Directors and HR by telling them falsehoods, namely that as BI’s profile increases Analyst and Associates are getting “picked off” by the Street. This is a straight up lie and highlights the character and integrity of BI Management. People are voting with their feet and the turnover rate is reflective of the complete lack of confidence BI management and the product they have created.

BI Management’s primary business strategy is ‘putting lipstick on a pig’. Given the extremely low quality of the product BI’s management have created, this approach is logical. Helping execute this strategy are Directors of Research and Team Leaders. Their aim is to strong arm subordinates into submission like the prison guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment. The qualities required to be a Director of Research or Team Leader are straightforward -- lack of research ability and empathy for the people they lead and most importantly a willingness to continue BI Managements organizational deceit without any questions. In short, these are people who lack a back-bone and enable Bloomberg LP to continue being conned….and for this, they are richly compensated by BI Management. Management is aware that Directors of Research and Team Leaders are unemployable outside of BI...and effectively pay them to perpetuate the scheme... 

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that Bloomberg can not solve the problems in its Intelligence department with the same level of thinking that created them. Most in the department expect Bloomberg’s Board of Directors to eventually axe BI’s entire management team if not the whole department when they figure out the reputational damage BI has caused.

The owner of Bloomberg L.P. and potential 2020 presidential candidate has proclaimed “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!”...So long as BI persists in its current form, sadly this statement should be viewed as false.","Advice to the owner of Bloomberg L.P. and the Board of Directors....first fire BI management...then answer the question ""How was this organizational deceit allowed to occur for so long?""",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,bloomberg

- Unique client base

- Snacks, daily soup, flavored water
- Philanthropy"," Sales and analytics groups are miserable to work in mostly because of management.
- Management is inflexible and in many cases incompetent and ignorant. 
-Most middle managers delegate their work to their already overworked subordinates.
- High turnover throughout the company, its a revolving door. People are constantly leaving because they are unhappy or being pushed out by management because they are not liked (even if you're performing).
- Most of the people who enter analytics will only have one career path, sales, which is also becoming miserable.
- Company reorganizes itself every 6-8 months. This is exhausting, its like as soon as you get really good at doing something its time to change it up in terms of company direction, focus, metrics and teams.
- No motivation/incentive to work beyond 8-5. Bonus is nothing to incentivize employees. Constant micromanagement.
- Huge focus on ineffective cold and warm calling. Its all about numbers. The calls you make will insult your intelligence and they are annoying the client base. This is done so management can make itself seem productive to senior management.
- You are under a microscope. They read your chats and emails. You feel like you can not take bathroom or coffee breaks. If you're going to be 2 minutes late, better email your manager.
- Management doesn't know how to staff support que's so everyone is always extremely stressed and at capacity. Majority of analytics does not have confidence and feels like they are constantly walking on egg shells.
- Purely a customer support role. Not an analyst or finance role. Almost everyone in the department would leave if they could.

Let's start with the work environment. The offices are some of the nicest, tech friendly offices in the New York City. The 731 Lexington Ave location is always buzzing with energy. Most people are very friendly and approachable, and the company encourages collaboration accross departments. 

Next, the benefits and perks of working there are amazing. Free health insurance (given passing a biometric screening), great time off & sick pay, free snacks & coffee 24/7 and lots of other great perks. 

Learning opportunities are abundant at Bloomberg. They provide loads of in-house training, as well as tuition reimbursement for graduate school as well as financial designations. 

Lastly, the environment is anything but hostile. I've made hundreds of friends in my time working there, and I truly believe the people are what makes the company great.","That being said, there are areas where Bloombrg could improve as a company.

Career advancement is a HUGE issue at Bloomberg. The flat hierarchical structure lends itself to many employees leaving the firm to advance their career, or taking on laterall moves that ultimately do not fulfill their desires for advancement. 

Amazing benefits do come at one clear cost - below average compensation packages. They tend to start out new hires at superior salaries, but over time the growth just is not there and after a few years you will lag behind the industry. 

Lots of politics and engineering has WAY too much control. Product managers should be driving engineering, not the other way around. At times there are too many cooks in the kitchen, causing delays in projects and stifling innovation.","Change the ""No-Titles"" policy and create a clear-cut career advancement platform.

3. Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine. This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs. The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either. You'll get a bonus each year and some stock. It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume: After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career: Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there. Double that for vendors. It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company. Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too. Not familiar with the stack rank? Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade"".","I'll type it here - but I don't they are listening...
1. Help proven talent move laterally in the company for new opportunities.
2. Kill/evolve the stack rank. Here's basically how it's viewed:. 30% of the company gets 1s and 2s - and they are happy. 50% get 3s and that basically feels like getting a ""C"" in school. This sucks for talented people when a multitude of UNCONTROLLABLE conditions keep you from getting into 1 or 2 range. The 20% getting anything below a 3 are walking dead. In summary, 70% of the company walk away from the review cycle feeling like crap. This is no good.

After 10 years, I'm leaving - it's just a matter of time until I find the right opportunity. I need to find a company spends 90% of it's time building technology experiences, as opposed to 90% of its time building PowerPoints. And I expect to refuse the exit interview - because if you really cared what I thought, you wouldn't ask me after I decided to leave.",4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,microsoft

High expectations without a concrete goal - often times, managements expects you to work hard, make impact etc, without any clear goal or objective. 
Not the best place for women for a long term career. Microsoft in general is trying hard to improve its image about gender bias, however, in technical role, with close to 90% male employees it is not a good environment for women to stay long term. 

For short term this is a great place to learn and having experience in Microsoft goes a long way in your resume. I would recommend Microsoft as a place to start your career, then, have a exit strategy before you burn out. 
The culture and work schedule / demand will take up most if not all of your time. This is a highly competitive place and demands all your attention and energy, which in turn can cause lot of stress. As long as you can work hard to get the great review, this will be a good place for you. You should plan to leave as soon as you realize that you are not able to keep up with the demand.",,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,microsoft

There is a major disconnect between HR and supervisors on the production floor. We are treated like incompetent children by HR. They do not take the time to establish a professional relationship with us. The communication between HR and management here is extremely poor. There is no chain of command in the way information is delivered. Quite often the associates will receive pertinent information before the supervisor. This place is also not a safe place to work at.

Orientation talks about how Samsung Values its people and its corporate responsibility. But reality is different. There are managers/executives that shout and yell at employees as if we were in the Middle Ages.

- Friendly work from home policies
- Great people","When I started at Cisco, they were still doing the free drinks, free food, and beer parties on Friday. That went away as soon as the downturn started, and then the layoffs began shortly thereafter. The first couple of years they laid off the bad people, and then there weren't any bad people left, so they just started flailing the axe at random. Every year around late summer, it swings again, so everyone is just sitting in dread waiting to see who goes. Then, afterwards, you have to try to figure out how to get things done when important pieces of your team aren't there anymore. 

It's still an okay place to work, and the people who are left below upper management are all great. I wouldn't tell you not to take a job there, but be aware that you're going to spend every summer wondering whether you'll have a job in the fall.","I volunteer with University Recruiting for Cisco, and the college students always ask me about the layoffs.

2724,Tue Oct 29 2019 10:49:31 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Great place to work... if you aren't in Sales.,I have been working at Salesforce full-time for more than 3 years,14.0,"Salesforce runs a sales organization like no other. Even if you have been a seller for 30 years, one full year at Salesforce will elevate your game. You will leave here a far better seller than when you arrived. Their operational expertise, sales execution, deal inspection, etc., are better than anyone in the business (for now). 

I've worked with some of the smartest people I ever have in Enterprise software. Imagine the top 10% of the sellers at your current company. Now imagine that the entire Salesforce sales organization consists entirely of that top 10%. Yeah, that describes the intensity.","The executive leadership team at Salesforce exemplifies the values they espouse and they truly believe that the world can be changed by business. Unfortunately, the values that are core to our belief system (doing what's right for the customer, trust, etc.) do not filter down to the actual sales process. There's a tendency to encourage customers to do things unnatural to their buying process, all in the interest of making the month. 

You will subjected to immense pressure here. The company, to their credit, has tried to emphasize wellness with meditation rooms in each office, etc. But much like volunteer time off, I know very few sales people that have time to enjoy those perks outside of offsites.

With only 50% of AEs exceeding plan, your success depends entirely on timing and territory. AEs who have not missed their number in years come to Salesforce only to fail because the alchemy involved in assigning quotas. There's a reason why so many AEs turn over after less than 2 years. 

It's unfortunate as the company really wants to do well in the world. The","Re-evaluate the sales team's metrics for success and what will ultimately make the company successful long term. As a leader, I'm evaluated on one thing - ACV. Financially, there's no incentive to develop my sales reps, make them better, help them find new roles within the company, help them evolve into the next generation of leaders, etc. 

Your incentive plan dictates the actions you want leaders to take. If ACV is a manager's only focus, what do you think the manager will focus on to the exclusion of all else? Incorporate metrics around employee satisfaction, retention, development, etc. The message you have been sending is that salesforce does not want leaders, only sales managers. 

More importantly, based on the metrics that are important to the company (i.e. growth and ACV), the managers who excel are the ones that drive their teams into the ground. Yes, it's an enterprise software company and yes, ACV matters, but the question leadership needs to ask itself is ""at what expense?"" 

In my little over 3 years here, it's apparent there's been a shift in the culture. Whether that's the ""Oracle"" undercurrent that's been forming over the past few years or simply challenges in the business, Salesforce has definitely lost it's glimmer as a destination career.

Management is extreme micro-managers. Expect pipe reviews 3x a week. Your 1-1 times with your managers tend to be more of a pipe review session than a career advancement meeting.

After someone leaves (Which is extremely high turnover). Management usually blames that person for everything (Including why the team is doing poorly.

Your quota's are not in alignment with company growth strategy. 
i.e. - generally a company will align compensation closely with what the business is trying to achieve. If a company wants 30% growth, they tie quota to 40-50% growth for instance. Our whole division did an audit on our patches, and in order to hit your quota, you were responsible for ~210-300% GROWTH in your patch. A divisions goal for the year was only 20-30% growth YoY.

- Pay for your own parking (penalized for not living in the city)

- Worst career decision I have made from a skill set perspective (no marketable skill set growth outside of the company)
- Company liberal agenda constantly shoved down your throat
- Employees placed into a silo
- Mandatory holiday work for Marketing Cloud so other companies can send more spam to people who do not want it
- SRE team mandatory weekly on call rotation recently went from 4 weeks/year to 15 weeks/year (yes, seriously, and that is the main reason I quit Salesforce for a real #dreamjob elsewhere)
- The company itself provides no real benefit to society so they allow employees to volunteer to feel fulfilled on the inside but really it is thinly veiled attempt at marketing and promotion of the company

- Company seems to reward bad client behavior instead of correcting it
- I am tired of typing but there are definitely more cons than pros","Live the values you preach. Stop making your employee's lives worse instead of better. Indy is a small tech community and once word gets out, which has already begun, you will experience a much harder time than you already do recruiting talent and more importantly, retaining talent. There are numerous local, successful startups sucking top talent out of the Marketing Cloud. The best employees and thought leaders are leaving in droves. I do not expect this to stop anytime soon. The brain drain continues and talented employees are being replaced with less talented, cheaper labor, like Bob.

Additionally, the client support experience is a nightmare now that you began replacing skilled engineers with unskilled, low cost overseas workers who can barely speak/write/comprehend English.

The people are great and their is a real team environment. People really want to help and do the best for the team and the customer. I've never seen another company close to this. Salesforce also follows a model that donates 1% of revenue, 1% of time and 1% of product to charity. As an employee, I get 5 days of Volunteer Time Off and charitable donation matches. It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time. Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia. Salesforce is also trying to be sustainable and is a carbon-neutral cloud. . No other company can say that. Compensation aside this company is a 7 on a scale of 1-5.","That said the compensation is a quagmire of BS. First you can already expect an OTE significantly less than what is the norm in the industry. Worse still is the 40 acts of vaudeville to figure out if you will get paid, if you get paid and what amount they base it on. We are out there saying use Salesforce as your system of record and every month my Xactly has little similarity to my sales in Salesforce. Come on, guys. Let's not be hypocrites! Then when you think it can get no worse there is a virtual rubics cube of ways you lose ACV or see $ clawed back. You have to be an accountant to figure out if you can sell to an account and retire quota. It's ridiculous how many times, in a short time I have not gotten the full value of my sale due to some arbitrary attrition I was not even aware of as a co-prime. Do you want me to sell or do you want me to audit the accounts to see if I can retire quota with a sale?",Get Xactly to match Salesforce dashboards and stop the clawback BS.

Nice view from the upper floors","Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. 
- 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened.
-Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review.
- No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. 
- If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. 
- If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. 
-Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. 
-No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. 
-If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" 
- Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. 
- When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. 
-If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion.","Hate to break it to you, but you aren't all that. Your technology stack is antiquated, think Oracle lite. You are an employer, you are not and never should be anyone's family. Your employee turn over rates continue to go up, this is not a good sign. The people that remain cannot go anywhere, golden handcuffs, lack of real technical knowledge. As a company you are slow to move, lack agility, and if anyone ever decides to seriously compete, you are in trouble. Oh, and Benioff is a good businessman, he is not the 2nd coming. The slavish devotion is off putting to anyone with a healthy world view. EVERYONE should be questioned, that is how you learn and grow.

High pay, though they don't have as frequent stock refreshes as other large tech companies.","Sort of bizarre workplace environment & culture. I didn't see much in the way of manager training or ensuring that the right ICs were promoted to people manager roles. Annual reviews are in no-way transparent. You are assessed on a set of criteria that is not shared with you (either the criteria or the assessment results). My review was five minutes: ""You're doing great!"" There was no actionable feedback, stretch goals or written documentation for me to learn and grow from.  Leadership in my org very often resorted to bullying and openly shared negative feedback on their own peers with their reports. Several times while working there, I lost my engineering title due to re-orgs and was told that they ""didn't want to transfer headcount,"" so was left with only limited technical work to do for long stretches. And that's my biggest complaint - at least in my org, hard and innovative work was not championed but rather avoided in pursuit of very easy and short-term goals.","If people are hired into engineering roles, do not take those titles and work away. If re-orgs require engineering work to move, please ALWAYS move the engineers with the work. It's extremely damaging to a person's morale, technical growth & career options otherwise.

- Truly a business-impacting company (i.e. not just trying to sell software), transformational capabilities
- Career Path is astounding, the ability to explore/try new roles as the company grows is a solid differentiator."," Pace: simply put, the frenetic company growth is unsustainable.

Annual quotas that continue to go up isn't something that go on forever, right?
- Management: The company is growing so fast, first-line managers are going to be the weakness that cripples this company. Not saying there aren't good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones. To fill the void, Salesforce hires externally (i.e. Oracle) who brings their less-than-desirable practice into Salesforce. Lack of homegrown leadership is the company's biggest weakness, by far

Long term vision balanced with execution focus to meet and exceed Wall Street expectations. M&A reflects humility that other companies have certain capabilities that are better to buy than try to catch up to internally.,"F&S leadership is floundering - they delay communicating bad news and let the rumor mill run amok, while they post cursory cheerleader-positive messages all the time on Chatter about work anniversaries. The finance team's technology is a decade behind and it will be at least another two years before they catch up - in the meantime, leadership are holding F&S headcount basically flat so workloads are piling up. If their processes were airtight it would be manageable, but this is a 40,000+ person company that still creates headcount plans in google docs and can’t decide what “materiality” means. Every process here has at least three exceptions, none of which are officially documented. 

Coupled with a very hot job market, this means that F&S employees have left at a high clip in 2019, at all levels of the organization. The CFO has decided that hiring in Finance should default to being in Indianapolis, a fact that was not well-communicated, and nor was the end state; does this mean the entire leadership team will sit in San Francisco while the analysts and managers will be 2,000 miles away?

Too many people have spent their entire careers here - they think their culture and way of doing things are inherently superior because the company has been so successful - I argue the company has been successful in spite of those things rather than because of them. 

The “Ohana” obsession feels cultish, and the idea that everyone has to be nice to each other is great, except certain teams are very noticeably exempt from that expectation while others are expected to toe the line. Either this applies to everyone or it’s window dressing and PR.","Drop the dual-CEO structure; it slows down decision making and creates ambiguity in acute situations. A company at this scale needs Keith as the sole CEO and for Marc to take a step back as an adviser. 

To the CFO: actually live the “trust” value by being upfront with your people. When we hear from you it feels like you only address the positive stuff.

(2) Title inflation: When I accepted the job offer, I thought I would make a career progression, which it was title wise, but after I joined I realized that I had in fact less responsibility than before. This wasn't obvious to me because the compensation was considerably higher than at my previous company. I wished I had asked more questions and had asked for a higher title.
(3) No cafeteria at HQ: you need to leave the building to grab food. This by itself is not a big issue. In fact, it means you have so many different lunch options ... every day.

2894,Sat Feb 23 2019 15:35:09 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Vice President Sales,"Jacksonville, FL",Current Employee ,A wonderful company that is starting to not be so wonderful,I have been working at Salesforce full-time for more than 5 years,114.0,"Salesforce is a destination company and there are few places where you will find so many truly interesting and gifted people in one firm. There is a real effort to continue to promote the company's values, including trust and equality. Support for philanthropy is significant (although I would agree with the reviewer who noted that ""volunteer"" activities are often anything but voluntary but rather expected/required. (Not to say that giving back is anything other than positive, but it's just worth noting that most company activities include it as part of the agenda.)

The customers are interesting and the tech is pretty solid. The benefits are what you would expect from a firm that wants to hire top talent, in other words, extensive and high quality.

The company continues to grow at quite a fast rate, and that is an imperative. The acquisitions are part of that and it's quite clear that they are necessary since there is only so much organic growth coming out of the core businesses. If you are in a ""good"" territory / team / department, this may in fact be a dreamjob. There are quite a lots of employees who are able to devote many hours (days) to volunteer causes, company social functions, training opportunities and so on. This is particularly the case if you are employed in one of the hub offices.","The rapid growth and the pressure around quarterly metrics is starting to come at the expense of cohesion and quality. The annual reorganization of the business is quite disruptive and is particularly problematic in business areas where the sales cycles are longer, like the more heavily regulated verticals or larger enterprise environments where aligning stakeholders and building vision takes time. You can work your &#$# off here and have all that worked handed off to someone else in a new fiscal. Happens a lot.

Above the mid management/senior director level, the political environment resembles the Hunger Games. The lack of capable management and the lack of transparency around career progression / promotion are a drag on the business and a significant business risk. The departures of more tenured people should be very concerning to leadership; just look at the difference in the reviews of new (<1 year) employees and those with 5 or more years of experience. It's not a positive marker. There is a reason that the employee survey now asks about the ""psychological safety"" of our workplace. Leadership should be commended for recognizing that this is a problem, but now needs to actually do something to fix it. Just adding a feedback app and calendar reminders to use it are probably not going to get the job done.

Once you are hired, progression within the company can be difficult. There is a policy that all internal transfers should be lateral in terms of grade and compensation, even if an external candidate with the same credentials would be offered significantly more compensation and a bigger title. There is a sense that the only way to get a promotion is often to threaten to (or actually) resign and unfortunately, plenty of evidence that this is an effective strategy.","The company's attention to culture, values and social justice are admirable. Recognize that those efforts also create an expectation within the firm that ALL management will demonstrate those values - something that is far from reality. This is not a problem that is going to be solved with Trailhead. Cultivating good people managers who can support and develop talent within the company should be as much of a priority as sales, and great management talent should be celebrated and rewarded. Likewise, those who treat people poorly, have significant attrition or staff departing for other teams should not be retained in management positions.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,salesforce

- Employee success is really good.
- There are some genuinely talented people who can help you learn.
- If you get on a good team (which is a stroke of luck), you might have some good projects to work on.
- Good brand name & external perception.
- Depending on team and your abilities to talk in badly run meetings, you may end up experiencing a huge growth."," A very unsafe culture. Predatory behavior in meetings. Only a white can do such a thing and not face any consequences because trust is a right for the whites and for colored it is a loosely hanging privilege which might be lost anytime and needs to constantly work on earning the privilege. I saw people even at Sr.Director level (who was colored) just leaving the meeting not knowing what to say or do. Eventually that Sr.Director (who was top notch) left the team in the name of personal reasons. Believe it or not, those whites even got promotions and MVP awards.

- Nepotism is prevalent. I was fully surprised by the way an engineering lead was lifted up to a top level leadership level so quickly (< 3 months since joining) without producing any good results. He was referred by another well positioned person in the team. The guy lacked humanity and was untrustworthy. He was aggressive, inconsistent, unresponsive, over-confident and was stepping on others toes a lot. Even providing feedback in the feedback app with facts to stop doing such things didn't help.

- Absolutely no transparency in promotions. People who did great things didn't get promoted and they left. I was a founding engineer who worked for closely 2 years. Many of the peer reviews were extremely positive. I was involved in some of the top level architecture meetings, was openly stated in those meetings that this is a really critical piece so i was needed to do it and ultimately got the job done from me, only to let a white take over the project once it was done and I saw others getting promoted who built on top of the work I had done. My manager didn't say any bad things in our 1:1s, he promoted others, resigned and just before leaving he talked to me for a minute over a phone call and we never met. I was the biggest fool to trust these people.

- I was low balled on the pay and the recruiter lied to me that salesforce doesn't do any sign on bonus and negotiations.

- Extremely operations heavy culture. Once a product is built and released to the customers, the pace at which things move is unbelievably slow. Leadership kills innovations, condescends on engineers who innovated and worked hard to build the product and makes everything operations centric."," Passive aggression is building up. 
- Bias, nepotism, sugar coating is all over the place. 
- Doing the right thing is not valued.
- In the name of team play, there is absolutely no boundaries, accountability and reliability. People with good political skills thrive in this environment by making others do their job (it's a team play and everyone should say yes to everything, right?).

Find a way to solve the above problems. I know it is hard because there is no visibility of the front liners work to the management and you are choosing to trust some people to lead and manage. Most importantly find a way to stop predatory behavior of whites in meetings to make sure people are respected and treated well so they can feel safe to come to meetings and office everyday.",3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,salesforce

Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 

8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). 

If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. 

Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. 

SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV)

Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. 

BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!)

As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense.","SDRs, BDRs, and AEs need more collaboration. Management should be more aligned to help this collaboration. 

BDRs should be measured very differently then they are now. What is currently in place is not a successful business model. The people that actually stay in the BDR role are typically the ones that end up being weak salespeople - AKA not ""hungry closers."" You are losing really great sales talent because of this.

Put more emphasis on BDRs having better customer service skills and really driving the sales process longer - rather than just throwing meetings at AEs who don't always have time to follow up. It is confusing for the customer to have so many different POCs. This would help the AEs save time, help BDRs learn and develop, make customers more inclined to buy, and be better for overall talent retention.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,salesforce

Many of the sales reps are unhappy with many things but stay because of how well the company performs/innovates. Base salaries are extremely low. There are very few people that are hitting their annual numbers and the overall compensation plus base is just not there. So much of it is based on territory but leaders will say to their graves that all territories are even. We would have much more appreciated it being called out vs. lying to our faces that they are all spread equally. 

Overall there is a lot of negativity here and much of this stems from the unhappy customers. Salesforce customers, especially in the SMB space don’t have the money to spend to implement Salesforce so their orgs are bad and adoption is extremely low. Account executives are responsible for selling - but also dealing with all unhappy customers, cancellations, technical support questions, etc. It doesn’t help that the renewals and billing teams are both outsourced to foreign counties and are extremely hard to work with (both internally and externally).

What makes this worse is the outward perception of equality Salesforce is generally known for, is not a reality for most of these underserved groups. There was a recently an ask from the top to stop being so political and ""back-stabbing"" in nature to senior leadership. The irony being those in that room in the vast majority were successful at Salesforce by being just that way. They have no business being responsible for fixing the culture they created and benefitted and continue to benefit from every day.","For once actually hold people accountable for their actions in being discriminatory. Stop retaliating against those who bring up the clear cases of bias esp. when they are putting themselves at great personal and career risk in doing so.
Stop proclaiming to the world that we are leaders in equality when our top-level leadership is dominated by white men and generally in top four layers of the organization by white people generally.

It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry.

The ability to volunteer using VTO, but agree with others. In some teams it is not volunteer work, you are required to put it in your V2MOM and complete it on some teams. The ability to do interesting work, connect with other talented individuals, and the training/learning opportunities.","On a recent survey, two of the lowest scoring questions revolve around people politicking and backstabbing to get things done and the lowest score company wide was promotions are handled in a fair and transparent way. The promotion question has been a bottom 5 scoring question for 2 years now. I have witnessed people promoted either for unfair reasons or because threatening to leave. They pass off a promotion as someone being promoted when in all actuality they applied to an internal job posting and were hired, that’s not really a promotion. The answer to fixing this is not more documentation on careers.
They put on a front that they value trust and transparency. They want you to be able to have difficult conversations with your manager without fear of retaliation, but I have witnessed people who speak up and are retaliated against with maybe a Performance Improvement Plan or a demotion. I sometimes feel as if managers and leaders here are talking the talk but not walking the walk when it comes to truly living by the Ohana values.
There is a feeling on some teams that it is easier and less stressful not using your PTO vs using it. Tough finding and training multiple backups to handle their job and yours while out.
Recently a decline in billable work that has them reassigning people to new careers. It is tough seeing work sent to vendors in India when people at Salesforce are struggling to get billable work.
Bonus for some 100% based on billable work which you have no control over. Person A could have 4 accounts and 40+ billable hours, resulting in a very healthy bonus; while Person B might have 1 account and is receiving 10 hours of work, receiving a much smaller bonus. The division of labor is not fair and should be distributed more evenly.
Seems a bit unfair when Salesforce gives an executive a $200,000 car and $86,000 watch as a bonus for exceptional work, when you have witnessed others do exceptional work on a smaller scale (not necessarily bringing in $8 million in Sales) and all they get is a Chatter shoutout from their manager or their name mentioned on a PowerPoint slide.
I agree with another review here...it is tough dealing with a travel ban, not being able to travel to visit coworkers during a Christmas party, but the top people were all in Hawaii that year. I remember that.","There is a problem here with people being afraid to speak up. I feel a majority want to remain anonymous because they are afraid of retaliation if they speak up. People need to see evidence of others who spoke up and the company actually did the right thing afterwards.
Better training or ways to evaluate leaders and management. These are the people that play a huge part in job satisfaction, career growth, psychological health, and being an advocate for their subordinates. If a promotion was unfair and not transparent, it is the manager and the people approving those promotions that should be looked at.",2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,salesforce

It’s deeply saddening that the actual experience working in Technology and Products is one of constant battles between the cross-functional groups.,"Tension is normal and healthy between different disciplines but here the interactions across PM, UX, and Engineering are aggressive and lack empathy for each other. The focus is on each of the 3 separate orgs - you are on the ‘UX team’, ‘Eng team’, or ‘PM team’ instead of defining culture around the cross- functional team working on a product. This often results in aggressive behavior where each discipline intimidates the other to do what they want or pass blame when something goes wrong. The exec leaders of these orgs verbally battle it out with each other in very public reviews that are streamed across their entire orgs and this sets the example that trickles down throughout the teams.",Offer a way for any employee to point out behavior that does not support the Ohana in a method that feels safe and have the option to get support over the interaction. Hire behavioral coaches that observe interactions in reviews and coach our leadership how to conduct debates and discussions without aggression.,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,salesforce

3022,Wed Apr 10 2019 07:25:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Senior Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,"Huge, quickly growing company where it's hard to do good work",I worked at Salesforce full-time for more than a year,5.0,"Salesforce is a hugely successful company hiring 19K people from 2018-2020. Visionary CEO Marc Benioff, created an idealistic culture where employees are paid to volunteer 50 hours a year, and the company matches their charitable donations up to $10K a year. At the company's San Francisco headquarters, employees have daily access to the best view on the West Coast, the 61st floor of Salesforce Tower. The workforce is generally smart, professional, and ethical. There are plenty of resources. Managers are on the whole receptive to new projects.","Because Salesforce is growing so fast – doubling its workforce and revenue over two years – many things get lost in the shuffle. Some teams have crushing workloads, while others are virtually forgotten. The prevailing infrastructure of the company is a parochial network of vice presidents operating independently. This leads to disconnection, and occasionally chaos. Teams duplicate work, work in contradictory directions, and compete pointlessly. Territoriality for budget and resources is rampant. There are no centralized checks and balances. If you have a bad or unethical warlord, you may be asked to do things that are counterproductive or even hurtful. The patchwork of fiefdoms across the company is so disconnected that many teams are unaware of similar teams within the company. Efforts to organize or connect strategies are met with resistance and sometimes hostility. A chief strategy officer with a team of connected project managers could address this, but many VPs don't want accountability. The result is work that doesn't rise above mediocrity. Salesforce is a great company comprised of dozens of mediocre companies. Those mediocre companies don't want to connect and be great because their leaders don't want to lose status. Once you see that you can't unsee it. Many workers grow cynical as a result. The famed ""Ohana"" (Hawaiian for family) doesn't penetrate the 300-yard stare of hardened coworkers who don't say hello in elevators.","It is incumbent upon the C-level executives to coordinate their teams and break down silos. The weakest layer of the company is the VP strata. Those leaders need pressure to work together, share resources, and adhere to centralized strategies.",3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,salesforce

Great appreciation for innovation, research and improvements.
Steady growth in terms of career, and a lot of possibilities for personal development - like internal lectures/conferences, partner programs with universities, web learning portals, domain experts, etc.
Bleeding edge technology and experts in multiple fields, ties to the scientific R&D - and you can take part in any of those fields and acquire knowledge from experts.
Competitive salaries.
Management is mostly built of people with serious practical background, so they have a lot of understanding what is going on, and a vision that is both very practical, AND innovative.

ESPP in particular is great generally, and has been amazing over the past 10-ish years.
- Fellow engineers tend to be dedicated and skilled.
- Being in a fabless semiconductor company provides unique challenges compared to say, transmitting advertisements 1% faster."," A switch to ""Agile"" development was done by people who have no idea what Agile is
- Depending on your team, if you don't put 6 hours in per day in JIRA, you will get a nag email. Helping other teams? No way! Going to meetings? Well, not too many...
- Corners are cut frequently. You will never feel proud of your work, always surprised it shipped.
- Does some task require special expertise? Well here is a 1 hour meeting about it a week after the task needs to be done. Maybe just read the slides, no time to actually attend that meeting. Want to read a book to understand the topic better? No way, there is no JIRA task for that.
- Employees complained about lack of Learning and Development resources so, they paid for Coursera. Not enough for all employees, so you may have to wait. No support for learning on the job, so I guess the idea is that you'll log in on a weekend to watch videos that are often freely available.
- Very few retros/post-mortems, multiple chips will go by without your team stopping to explore why testplans are always being trimmed to be actually completed, and even then very few changes will be implemented.
-Maybe you will work 12 hours a day , 7 days a week for months. Well enjoy your expensed lunches and dinners on the weekend, that's all it's going to get you. Counts for nothing towards management, Just say No when they ask.",,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,nvidia

Rank and seniority don't mean a lot. If your idea is good, it doesn't matter who you are or how long you've been here.
Lots of people here who literally wrote the book on their technological specialty.
Zero tolerance for ethnic/racial/gender/age discrimination. That's not from HR, it's everywhere. Do or say something that appeals to stereotype or prejudice and people think you're an idiot. Maybe that's how things are in 2019 techworld, but it sure is refreshing.

Agile decision making and course correction to stay on track with product roadmaps.
Company does not live in the past or rest too much on past success.
Fair amount of work/life balance (as long as you take responsibility).","Not suitable for people who aren't self-starters - often frustrating when onboarding to a new team to get very little help from peers which results in wasted trial/error.
A lot of tribal knowledge and sparse/outdated internal documentation/websites make it difficult and inefficient to find information.
Matrixed org structure leads to firstline managers with unmanageable amount of direct reports resulting in very low opportunity for focused one-on-one time, coaching, and development.
Too much focus on projects and staffing at Headquarters - this leads to limited growth/movement opportunities for people outside of California.
Rapid growth is stressing the company's resources and historically closeknit culture.","Thank you for being open, transparent, and most of all trusting your employees with the technical knowledge that you share globally within the company.

NVIDIA has grown up into a 14k+ employee global enterprise. It's time to realize that the old matrix/flat org structure isn't scalable anymore and doesn't support employee development. This is in large part due to managers who can no longer deliver results AND develop their people if their staff/scope is too large. 

Top level leadership should change the message to project/team managers that good talent may not necessarily exist (or want to live) in Santa Clara and they MUST be open to supporting cross-site teams. Otherwise, non-California employees will miss out on growth opportunities, get frustrated, and will be quickly recruited away by your competitors.",5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,nvidia

Their commitment to moving at the speed of light in every thing they do keeps such a large company nimble and able to respond quickly to shifts in the marketplace.",Moving at the speed of light leaves less room for process and more room for chaos. If you can handle a fluid org chart and requirements that change on sometimes a weekly basis for the bleeding edge projects then you've found the right home. If on the other hand you want stability and things that move with a little more deliberation then the hardware side of the house would be more your speed.,It's a little too easy for managers to carve out their own fiefdom and then defend it.

The mid-level engineering managers are either still active or used to be talented technical contributors, so they are usually trustworthy in terms of making good decisions.

For such a large company now, things still seem to move pretty quickly. There is heavy emphasis on execution here, so people are conscious about minimizing the overhead.

Again, the emphasis on execution allows the company to invest quite a lot into its internal workflow and methodology.

Very open environment encourages managers and new employees alike to engaging in technical discussions.

Competitive compensation. The company seems to be focusing more towards family-friendly employee benefits, which seems to be growing in popularity.

The importance of the work is obvious to most people, without the execs having to hammer such notions obnoxiously.","The department directors seem to be throwing around catchy/buzzworthy phrases from Harvard Business Reviews, without providing mid-level managers sufficient guidance on how to address them. I felt that this lack of guidance turns such business school memes into sources of management anxiety, which eventually trickle down as stress to engineers.

Some individual contributors agree that the managers are too busy and bit ""out of touch"" with the happenings in the latest projects. The management career path does not seem very appealing, since the individual contributors constantly witness their managers having to deal with weird crap all the time.

Heavy emphasis on execution often pushes many engineers into shortsightedness. You either get criticized here for not delivering on time, or being ""too shortsighted.""

Weird product/marketing naming schemes aren't always understood by the engineers. They are typically considerate to send someone from the marketing to explain. That is very nice, but it's still not clear whether such minutia is understood by our customers.

The work culture is bit chaotic, and challenges people to adapt to new environment. Those who insist on sticking to their work process at their previous job don't fare very well.","I understand why our directors would emphasize few catchy phrases to emphasize the pertinent organizational issues at hand, but please provide the mid-level managers some guidance or examples on how to successfully cope or address them.

There’s plenty of room to grow and move laterally throughout the company based on your interests. Managers are fair and great mentors. There are a wealth of people to support you in your work.

Very open, collaborative environment, you can reach out literally to anybody (including CEO) and get help. CEO reads status emails (!) and engages in discussions (!) with the teams about product directions and strategies (this is in AV org, not sure about others). 
I love the idea of workstream (virtual team) that can quickly summon people across the org, I haven't seen this type of thing in other companies.
I am a senior sw developer with 22 years in the Valley and worked at a few companies here and I can compare. NVIDIA is the best without any doubt.
Benefits are mostly fine, very good health insurance choices, some perks but don't expect a lot. New building was nice, but it felt unfinished, and any improvements take long time. 
NVIDIA generally has less office politics than I've seen in other companies. (Still it exists and frustrating). The 2016-2018 stock run up was nice, I didn't make a lot of money but still I can't complain.
A lot of your personal experience may depend on the team you join. There are absolutely horrible teams to work in (avoid IPP at all cost!), but also there are greatest and brightest teams. I did an internal transfer from an-ok team to a much better team (the transfer process was smooth and everyone was supportive). To compare my RSU increased more than 2x, with better wlb, I got much much more interesting projects, and the brightest minds to work with. So, lots depends on the manager and the team.","Growth for senior engineers like myself is really really not what it should be.
 RSU grants (vest over 4 years) are calculated as % of your salary, depending on your rating you get from 0% to 50%. You get rated NI (need improvement), FC (full contributor) with 2 categories A and B, and TC (top contributor) again with A and B. 
So TC-A gets 50% of salary in RSU grants - this is the absolute top compensation bump you could achieve no matter how brilliant you are and how big an impact you make. 
I think the other scale is FC-B gets 20%, FC-A 30%, and TC-B 40%. NI gets 0%.
Let's say you're a senior making 200K/year, if you're TC-A like myself it means you get 100K in RSU over 4 years, or 25K per year. After a couple cycles (2 years) you'll realize it's really not worth it all the effort and hard work for just extra 10% of salary. Stock can grow of course, but stock can also fall.

Endeavor building was not planned well - not enough bathroom capacity for number of occupants, people end up waiting for 10-15 minutes just to use a bathroom. Really don't know what to say here.

Parking situation is horrendous - again due to bad facility planning. If you come to work at 11am or later, forget about finding parking, valet will be full, and you end up parking illegally in neighbor parking lot. Go to work and fear all day you car will get towed. 
CEO was asked this question - his answer was - don't come to work at 11. Yeah, but we still have our lives, doctor appointments, our kids and loved ones, so it does happen sometimes I have to come to work later than usual.",Improve senior people compensation - share the success of company with the people who are behind this success.,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,nvidia

* Super transparent and surprisingly egalitarian

 I've worked at other tech companies where it's all double-speak. Here, the hire ups are just regular dudes with added responsibilities. It's surprising how you'll be chatting with some random guy and you find out later he's a director or something. I've never experienced this before and it's awesome.

* The technology is incredible and so are the people who work on it

 I know everyone is ""Making the World a Better Place! ™"" in the valley, but seriously though, what a time to be alive! Processors that were developed for insane graphics are now used for the world's most powerful supercomputers. What's even crazier is you meet the people who develop all these tools and again... they're just regular, humble dudes doing their life's work. Outstanding.

* You're not a peasant, you are an engineer at one of the best tech companies in the world

 Coming into Nvidia, I was worried it would be a turn and burn shop like Amazon or IBM. A sort of ""We own you, now work 90 hours a week, drink this kool-aid and love us"", but it's not like that all. You're an individual and you determine your involvement/focus. This sort of freedom is incredible.

* Have I mentioned how awesome people are?

 Seriously though. I show up to work so I can work on cool things and hang out with people.","There are a few, minor ones that are just kind of annoying rather than a hindrance

* Some of the Newer Hires

 So I'm a recent hire, but I've noted some trends with the newer hires. Nvidia has made it to the big time and with that, we can start pulling in people who were originally gunning for the FANGs. The problem is, a lot of those people just care about RSU's, insane perks and literally nothing else.

* More on some of the newer hires

 They whine about the dumbest, most entitled, first-world problems. I'm not entirely sure if that Orange Mocha Frappuccino that you were served at nvcafe is entirely vegan, gluten free and fair trade certified. I'm sorry Nvidia is so awful that we don't have personal butlers at our stand by, ready to get us a kale/tofu/avocado toast that other tech companies obviously do. I'm sorry the stock dropped a little so you can't get gold rims for your jet-ski. Oh the humanity!

 I could go on, but you'll see these complaints on Glassdoor and Blind. They just care about perks and RSU's. I don't really feel like they're employees, just mercenaries ready to hop onto next thing once all their RSU's vest.","Literally just keep doing what you're doing. There's a reason why Nvidia keeps adapting and pivoting to the top. Don't evercahnge into a turn and burn shop that focuses quarter to quarter. I've been at one before and it simply doesn't work.

* we have a very young and inexperience leaderships w/ bad attitude (not fit in their role). Because of that many projects are LATE, micro manage to NOT important tasks and we missed out schedule
* our team leader and management often not at work office and hard to communicate, show up 20-30min late in their own meeting w/ smell, sweat workout clothes and we have to start all over because of his action.
* Third party rank and rate our internal employee survey are low in the 20%, but second & third line manager travel to Austin w/ many ignore and un-answer to our concerns. Perhaps, they just want to show to their VP and CEO that they did travel to Austin site and had a team out to team building activity (like painting and eat until 9p) but there was not much to address our concerns and issues.
* we work w/o a life at home and the additional team building until 9-10p is not acceptable. We are also have family to take care after work.
*annual salary was nearly stand still in the past several years. They don't see what we worked to dead, they used comments to us during the performance review that they don't applied to them.
* managements stick to good old boy systems.
* I love pet at home and not at work. People bring their dog to work that bark and smell like a zoo. I personally don't think it is a healthy to bring pets to work to distract people surrounding in the company
* you can not pass the parking lot w/o going thru a group of NVIDIA employees smoking by the building

People who work here are generally friendly and cooperative.

Thanks to the company's success in the market, morale at the company is generally very high.

Subject to the demands of your work (see Cons) you have a lot of flexibility over how you manage your time.

Compensation seems competitive for the industry.

The company is a good corporate citizen and does try to give back to the communities in which it operates.

There's a refreshing lack of bureaucracy at the company.

The free coffee on the Santa Clara campus is very good.","The company can be quite disorganized sometimes. Lack of proper planning, an aversion to process, and an overoptimistic approach to scheduling occasionally causes even the most mundane activity to degenerate into a firefight.

On some projects, management has the unreasonable expectation that staff be available 24/7. On one occasion I was pressured into cancelling my evening plans to finish an urgent update (which was ultimately delayed until the following week).

The professional time off policy for exempt staff means that all vacation time is taken at the employee's manager's discretion. The possibility that some crisis might erupt during time off makes it impossible to disconnect completely. The need to ask a co-worker to provide cover during time can make employees reluctant to take any time off at all.

The company does not always live up to the ideal of intellectual honesty cited as a factor in the company's recent success. In reality, sometimes employees who try to resist bad ideas are considered as ""poor team players"".","Special Relativity 101: The speed of light not just a speed limit. It also demonstrates the law of diminishing returns.

The stock is on fire and everyone is thrilled about this. This is a great place to be if you are an intern, engineer, etc as NVIDIA is doing cutting-edge work that supports AI and Deep Learning industries. 

Some ability to work from home but it depends on your manager. Being able to do this infers a trust relationship between manager and report - this is on the wane. 

No vacation time here at NVIDIA. Instead, you can take what you need given your work load at the moment. Some folks put regular vacations on their calendar (a week every 3 or 4 months) just to make sure they're using their time off. Some folks abuse the heck out of this system. Many people will tend to check in while on vacation, never really disconnecting from work.","It is nearly impossible to grow your career here. Little opportunity or support for transferring into other departments or roles. 

Newer senior management are awash in politics and are more interested in building empires than in supporting their reports. 

No yearly cash bonus. Instead you get RSUs that vest over 4 years. If you contribute to your ESPP plan, they use that in factoring how much RSUs you get at focal review time. Not quite fair as ESPP is voluntary. and can change mid-period. 

Medical benefits are finally starting to compete with the rest of the valley but still lag on 401K contribution matching, cost of medical care for dependants, etc. 

Educational benefits at Stanford are primarily for CS, EE, EEE, AI majors. There is nothing for management or marketing professionals under this program. There is a separate program that covers just over $5000/year for other education, but this won't cover an MBA. It might cover one or 1.5 classes a year at Stanford. I haven't heard of anyone getting their MBA covered through NVIDIA like at other companies I've worked for.

Lunches are supposed to be subsidized, but it's less costly to go out to eat at a restaurant. No snacks provided. 

Because there is no official vacation time at NVIDIA, if you leave or are laid off and haven't used much vacation time, you've essentially lost it.

Meager to absent travel budgets. The management encourages those on global teams to just do video conferences to save money. CFO is constantly cutting costs and does a great job at this but sometimes we spend so much time on how to cut costs, or justifying expenses that we waste money in the lengthy discussion process.","To the e-staff & upper management:

Better support your non-technical staff on the education side. Don't be afraid of letting employees grow and learn. Support and encourage lateral moves more. We are more successful as a company when we learn and can better support each other.

Intellectual honesty is dying quickly as you bring in lots of middle and upper management from other companies that aren't aligned with our historical culture. 
These new hires aren't used to being honest about mistakes and lots is being swept under the carpet to keep you from seeing it. They don't want you to see where we're failing. The ""everything is roses"" song is getting old. You'd be surprised how much isn't working.

- We are a data based company and a very intellectually honest company. If we fail, we fail together, but we don't hind mistakes or make excuses. We learn why we made the mistake and we adjust.
- Down to earth people. During the development of a product, I had no issues getting our engineering SVP in a room to help make decisions and make the product a success.
- We have great leaders. 
- We are investing in productivity, and infrastructure to help us innovate. IT has not always been good and is not great yet, but is getting better so quickly. And we are building the most beautiful new HQ - Endeavor.
- Great ESPP
- Onsite perks are getting really good.
- Healthcare access is a priority 
- Parental leave is great
- Work-life balance is a priority
- We only hire great workers and for the most part human beings... :)"," We are growing very fast and it is challenging to fit everyone in from a facilities perspective. Meeting space is tight, but we have invested in meeting pods to help.

* Rare to encounter anyone who is ""phoning it in""; very efficient workplace and dedicated colleagues
* Execution speed is admirably fast; I'd be surprised if any peer company (e.g. Intel/AMD/Qualcomm) can deliver new products at NVIDIA schedules
* Flat hierarchy - titles are generally private, and authority comes from earned respect. The company is still small enough for individual contributors to get recognition from the top.
* Every year the company has improved and dealt with problems and deficiencies employees have brought up.","* Global offices and round-the-clock handoff means the work day never ends. It's only possible to unplug if you force yourself to, as there will always be more work than time.
* Constant feeling of being understaffed, even if that may not be accurate. Work is not always load-balanced well.
* Many teams appear to pile on a lot of technical debt and are unable to staff internal improvements.
* ""Speed of light"" schedules sometimes forget to account that we're not in a vacuum :)
* Used to be behind in perks, but that is improving, e.g. shuttle services. Food is slowly improving, although costs unlike some peer companies, and dinner food quality is awful. No snack options besides some antiquated vending machines.
* Conf call + webex setup feels antiquated. Behind on communications technologies, which is challenging when dealing with a global team. Progress is being made but it's slow.
* Underinvestment in social aspects: Rare for teams to ever go out or do team-building activities. Celebrations are rare. Alcohol-free campus dampens any relaxed communication. No holiday party (community service is the replacement, which is admirable, but can't think of why we can't do both...)","* Ensure that teams are staffing process improvements
* Less calls to action and more celebration/appreciation
* Staff to avoid heavy collaboration between teams of different timezones so that people can have more natural working hours.

Hard for some teams and people to preserve work/life balance. Some weekend work and email checking. Depends a lot of the team and person.
2. Only twice a year employee stock purchase plan, so if you join at the wrong time you get burned and don't get to participate for six months
3. Stock options are only selectively distributed based generally on how well you negotiated at hire, some people got good deals, other people got nothing, so get no benefit from the stock rally 
4. Office cubes can be a bit cramped, but at least it is not open office so one can concentrate with headphones on and its not too bad. Would be nice to have a bit more space and white noise though.
5. Promotions and bonuses only once per year. Twice per year would be nice.
6. Not much parking during peak times
7. Suffers from demo feature creep, and does a bit of smoke and mirrors in marketing, however the management is aware of the issues and knows how to make real products, so this is mainly an issue in early stage projects where a lot is in flux","Give more stock options to more staff, especially when you bring in senior people, i.e. not college grads.

This is great if you're new to SF and want to make friends w/ co-workers. - Unlimited PTO... but flexibility of PTO really depends on your manager and how well you perform as an associate. However, I've seen that as long as you give a month or more notice of a longer PTO (~2 weeks), and it's not during peak seasons like holiday, then you should feel comfortable asking your manager for time-off. - Kind, relaxed environment. General vibe of associates is pretty sociable, chill, and kind. Based on the other tech shuttles I've seen, Walmart associates definitely look a little less nerdy and tend to dress well. Despite there being lots of highly educated CSs from Ivies and other top schools, no one comes off as overtly competitive or socially awkward. I would say the company has a social environment. It's normal for CSs to hang out during weekends, go on weekend trips, and actually become close friends. Some teams are closer than others. Some teams are more competitive than others. It really depends where you end up getting placed. - Free fitness classes. I've taken the 3C class since I started working at Walmart.com. It's a really great workout class, offered multiple times a week. It's taught by an Equinox trainer."," Does not offer as many perks as other tech companies. No free food, only occasional free snacks. No company sponsored events except for Day at the Ballpark that comes once a year. No company holiday party. Once a month, we have an in-office Happy Hour. - Fires associates with little warning. Two associates on my team have been fired within the last 8 months. It's abrupt, and the rest of the team is left wondering why our co-worker has been let go. There's no explanation, and you can't ask because it's awkward, and the manager tells us that there's not much they can disclose. - You must go above and beyond to ""Meet Expectations"" during annual performance. Others on my team have struggled to even get ""Meets Expectations"". Managers say that doing what is required of you is not enough, and you must go beyond your role to meet or exceed. - No say in which category you get placed. After a year, you can request to transfer categories. But even so, it's difficult to move outside of your super-department. For instance, if you're in Home and want to be in Entertainment, it's recommended that you stay within Home. - Personal bias in performance reviews. My manager seems to have a personal bias that affects his/her judgement when it comes to firing or promoting associates on the team. I'm making this assumption based on the fact that two associates on my team got fired, for no outright fireable offenses. However, it was known that my manager did not seem to like these associates as much. Though I will admit these associates weren't as strong as others, they still did their jobs and were intelligent. What bothers me is that I talked to them both after the incidents, and they were both very shocked about what happened. One of them even said that in his/her last review, he/she got the feedback that he/she was improving. And I think if they were on a less strict team with a different manager, they would have been fine. This manager has also promoted others on my team quickly, quicker than what I think is fair. I was promoted as well, but I put in more time and helped trained the people who got promoted. The lack of transparency about firings and promotions among team members is discouraging. I'd like to trust my manager and believe that he/she is doing the right thing, but it's hard to do so with such little information about the reason behind the actions. I also think my team is held to a higher standard than a lot of the bigger teams at the company. I wish I was on a different team. - Managers like BS. So far, it seems to me that if you're really good at shamelessly talking yourself up, you'll go far. A girl on my team isn't much of a team player. She doesn't do much for the team as a whole, but she's really great at doing her own work and speaks well about her financials. She's not someone I want to work with and doesn't add much value to the team on a personal level; whereas, I'm always there for others on my team, take time out of my day to show others how to do things, etc. Because of this, I have to work longer and get less done. She got promoted alongside me even though I helped train her, and she started after me. It's things like this that I'm learning that corporate mobility is about self-interest and who can brag the most.",,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,walmart

Also, as stated in the reviews below the performance reviews are on a bell curve which makes everyone extremely competitive with eachother and honestly the feedback you get isn't even truly based on your category performance. Instead, it is based on if your manager likes you or not on a personal level. for the team I was on, it was SO obvious who the favorites were.

Toxic Review System. Tough Culture. High Turnover. The employee review process fosters a negative environment where sucking up is rewarded and employees have to campaign to grow. Reviews are not based on actual performance but based on who leaders are pushing forward for promotion each review round. All leaders discuss the candidates up for promotion and have to fight to get their associates promoted. This creates the suck up environment because associates campaign to get promoted with their leaders peers. This deters and takes away from the work. Great work and talent is not rewarded. Leaders say growth is owned by the associate. No accountability for fostering and building talent. This means there are no growth opportunities and leadership gives employees a ""figure it out yourself"" mentality. Being a ""yes man"" is rewarded, critical thinking and actually caring about the work and the end customer is completely disregarded. Top talent leaves because of this. Pay is not comparable to the tech industry at all. High turnover in leadership. Every 6 months the strategy changes due to new leaders. This isn't for innovation this is chaotic and all progress is set back because a new leader wants to prove themselves instead of evolving and building upon the successes that have been established. Leadership tries to say they operate like a startup, which is an excuse for a chaos and disorganization. This is Walmart, this is a well established brand with incredible brand DNA. STOP trying to sell it like it is something else and sell it for what it is, which is the longest standing, largest retailer in the world. Be proud of that. Managers are treated like entry level associates and are not given resources to elevate their work and continue to grow individually while impacting business and the customer experience to the most potential. Leadership continues to use budget to layer directly under themselves - Creating top heavy orgs. Bottom line everyone is so eager for their own growth they are failing to lift up and grow talent from the bottom up. Leaders don't actually want to manage people or do the work. Leaders will take credit for work and not give appropriate credit.

3525,Sun Aug 26 2018 01:21:04 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Senior Software Engineer,"Sunnyvale, CA",Former Employee ,Toxic work culture,I worked at Walmart eCommerce full-time for more than a year,13.0,*Pays better than many other companies. *Udemy courses online are free ( not all but most) which is the only learning opportunity within the company,"* No parking * horrible food * unassigned seating, have to hunt for a desk every morning, chargers, headphones ,chairs and other accessories get stolen if left unattended at desk, specially if left overnight. *Extremely political, extremely tight coupling between teams which is totally unnecessary, forcing collaborative work. With collaborative work, it’s not always clear who has done what, which leaves the door open for a colleague or your manager to take undue credit for your work. * People expect to be spoon-fed in the name of collaborating and get promoted regardless. * Allegiance is held in higher regard than actual performance. *Open communication is held against you. *Nepotism is prevalent. *No on-boarding *No goal setting * HR seems to be non-existent, its well known that HR is meant to safe guard the company's interests in every company, but still, in other places they do have some tools to keep managers in check from abusing their power so blatantly. We are expected to give our manager's 360 feedback in a simple email that goes to our director. There is no forum to keep the feedback confidential. Anyone who raises concerns becomes the system's target. * positions are falsely advertised. When you actually join the job, job description may not match the actual work you are given. *1 on 1 / 1:1 are formalities, its mostly a one directional conversation, no matter what you have to say, its never acknowledged by your manager or HR. Even if you show solid evidence, they will game the system to set you up for failure for next time. * Health insurance is not that great. * Unlimited PTO creates a competition to take lesser time off in the team. You have to have leverage with your manager to negotiate for PTO, this often comes at the cost of long unpaid extra hours on weekends and after hours, or some other kind of favor. At the manager's whim, even a preplanned PTO can be expected to be cancelled at last moment, with serious repercussions if the employee resists.

From the inside it's a different story.,"Extremely political, nepotism all around, quality is overlooked if you don't bow to your manager or director. Allegiance is held in higher regard than critical thinking. Open communication is frowned upon. Credentials, qualifications and experience are irrelevant as long as you're friend with the unit leaders or other cronies / puppets / minions. No development methodology, agile is a foreign concept, daily stand-ups are only ceremonial. The real work and progress relies on a few engineers on visa's, most product and program managers are accessories, almost ornamental. Systems to track features and stories are obsolete, no real sprint planning, no real sizing of features, no capacity planning, no real prioritization, no roadmaps, the pipeline is an abstract construct that is loosely defined, a black box. User and market research are completely unstructured , discussion or feedback is never welcome, very little tolerance to ponder new ideas other than those already set. Go to market is disorganized, no real strategy, no real plan, they wing it as they go. Bring many third parties to get stuff done in an incoherent manner but expecting stellar results. No budget or planning. Good luck trying to innovate and create amazing experiences, coming in and trying to look into customer loyalty you'll find literally walls when you talk to business stakeholders and executive level leaders, they'll throw around the EDLP or every day low prices company motto as gospel and you'll never get anywhere, you'll actually get blocked for the blasphemy. Mentality is entrenched in an old model that used to work 50 years ago but now prevents the company to evolve and compete with Amazon. Take for example the rudimentary breakdown of groceries and general merchandise that they currently have in their website, you can't put lettuce, eggs, and a toaster in your cart at the same time. Please ! Is this the way they're trying to ""integrate"" expensive brands like bonobos into the experience? Personalization is non-existent and the team is largely inexperienced, omni-channel is nothing but a mirage, order online and pickup in store is all they have and all there is. Analytics are underutilized, managers and directors couldn't care less about kpi's there's little understanding and even disregard of product data specially if it goes against one of the leaders in your team. No on-boarding for new team members, no goals setting by month or quarter, no retrospectives by sprint or quarter, no team goals alignment. Each team runs it's own way. Still you're expected to please your superior but if you don't you'll be shown the door, saw many instances of that, no reason, no discussion, just let people go, full timers and contractors alike.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,walmart

What they didn’t mention is that in reality, all the decisions are made by people higher up in the company, who often graduated from bottom tier schools like the University of Phoenix. The day to day of a category specialist can be summed up with one phrase: digital shelf stocking. It is literally like stocking shelves in a Walmart store, except online. You set up new items online by filling out extensive forms (tickets), remove items from the site, change out photos, and categorize items. It is as boring as it gets. To top it all off, many teams are very understaffed, with one category specialist doing the work of 10 category specialists. Despite all this heavy lifting, management is very hesitant to give out “exceeds expectations” reviews. I know many people who work hard and long hours and only “meet expectations” on their evaluations. Most importantly, there is virtually no structured training for the job. They give you a mere two weeks of training, where literally none of the dozens of outdated systems are taught to the new hires.

Another major problem is that category specialist are being hired for the same job but different category specialist are paid (starting salaries) at different levels even though we all do the same job. Just know that you can being the same job as someone else with the same title and being paid less.

When I was first hired, I was truly excited for the direction the company was going in to compete with Amazon. Aside from a smooth, yet misleading interview process, my entire experience thus far has been very unsatisfactory and has me looking to get out ASAP. Pay & Benefits-- For starters, if you apply to a Category Management role in the SF Bay Area, you will not be compensated for your market worth and will definitely be underpaid. The recruiters make it seem like the 10k bonus (or rather 6k bonus, after taxes) is a selling point-- don't let that fool you. In addition, you would think the benefits would help offset the lower salary, but that is definitely not the case. I know this may sound arrogant and a bit entitled, but when you're a company that makes millions in hours and you're also competing for top talent with Amazon, let alone in the Bay Area, you've got to step your game up. Culture-- Aside from mediocre pay and benefits, the office culture reeks of bureaucracy, politics, rigidness, and saps one of any energy and drive. It seems like most people are content and just going through the motions, while others are trying to turn Walmart into something its not-- an actually innovative and forward thinking company. Walmart's biggest selling point is that you get the experience of both a start up and big company-- but from my experience, any attempt at innovating, challenging the status quo, or simply lobbying to get projects worked on (because everything has to be approved by a director, director's director, VP, and so forth) makes it extremely difficult ""to move with speed"", ""agility"", or ""change the way we work""-- nothing but fictional words and phrases used to create the allure of a company that wants to be considered in the same league as its competitors. Management- During my time with the company, I've reported to 3 different managers- some better than others, but for the most part, management seems to lack the emotional intelligence/people skills required to develop and retain employees. I've never been in such a hierarchical-based company. At other companies I've worked for, even directors and leaders that your manager reports to would make time to hear your perspective and develop you.

However, with all the profit printing cartridges have rung up over the years, HP management and CTO really failed to ever invest in the “next business.” 3D print may become a good business over time, but it cannot be the only business. For a company that has the muscle and makeup for building hardware, HP has been inept at acquiring or home-growing any growth businesses.","You have to make some calculated bets. 2D print is not going to return the same revenue and profit over the next 10+ years that it used to. Acquire a complementary hardware company in a growth area - is it a POS company, a media streaming company, an IOT play... I don’t know, but I’m hoping you do. Whatever you do, don’t go for anymore value plays - I.e., a company on the decline - palm was a garbage buy, Samsung laser printer business was mediocre. Be bold, be creative, let’s gamble now while we still have the chips rather than just die a slow death by 1000 tiny cuts.

Also, you really need to take a hard look at your management. People unwilling to change, stuck on the old ways, wanting to play it safe, cut them.

4012,Sat Aug 10 2019 08:47:40 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),,, ,You’ll be just another cog in the gargantuan HP machine,I worked at HP Inc.,,"1. People. Coworkers were almost always great. 

2. Flexibility of work schedule. WFH and flexibility in working hours was great. 

3. Pay. I’ve yet to get a job that pays me even 64% if what I made at HP. 

4. Benefits Package. (PTO + insurance + retirement)

5. Company-provided equipment. (Laptops, monitors, etc) 

6. Empathy and compassion from management (depending upon your individual manager) if something tragic or traumatic happens. After the death of a parent, my boss let me take four weeks of paid bereavement leave that didn’t come out of my PTO balance.","1. The culture created by management. You’re just a cog in the gargantuan HP machine. HP cares not about your hopes and dreams or your career advancement. Even if you push hard for something like mentorship, which is something they promote, your requests will likely be ignored or pushed aside. 

2. Adherence to the bottom line creates job instability for employees. Sudden and unexpected layoff occur. I was “let go” and given fake reasons why. What it came down to was that I was laid off without HP calling it a lay-off so they didn’t have to report it, which would have been detrimental to the stock price. 

3. If you get laid off or let go, you won’t see it coming. I had a one-on-one scheduled with my manager. As we were walking to find a conference room, we chatted like it was any other day. Just chitchat. Then we walked into a conference room in a different building and he immediately hit me with the news I was being let go. When I questioned why, he gave me a made up reason related to my performance. When I challenged him and told me he was incorrect, he fumbled over his words and gave me a different reason that was equally made up. 

4. Lack of interaction with management. In the nearly five years I worked at HP, I can probably count on two hands the number of times I had real interaction (something beyond chitchat) with the two different managers for whom I worked. 

5. Also, if you accept a severance package, as I did, you will never be eligible for rehire. EVER. After working for HP for 4 years and just shy of 11 months, my severance package was a half a month’s pay, but no one ever told me I’d never be able to come back and my severance paperwork never indicated as much, either. 

6. Favoritism. This is definitely a problem. My first manager took the words of another person I worked with as the God’s honest truth when that person blamed me for a mistake she made. My manager never even asked me if I knew anything about the problem created by this other person. She just automatically assumed the problem arose because of me. I was told “you set us back weeks” after this other person mucked up some data she was analyzing for a new metric. This other person had asked me to look at the data and run a test, which I did exactly as she asked me to. I ran the test on literally 100 rows out of 100,000 rows for approximately 15 minutes and didn’t save anything. My second manager played favorites and I felt as if I had been “left behind” (for lack of a better term) while the other new hires I worked with were brought along much more quickly than I was. The other two new people on the team were given special treatment and paid special attention that I wasn’t. It helped if you were an athlete of some kind or if you liked mountain biking. That helped you “fit in” with the little clique created by my manager. Apparently I didn’t “fit in” because I didn’t join them on their mountain biking trek or their whitewater rafting trip one summer.",Shift a lot of your focus from stakeholders to employees. You’ll be more successful in the long run. Open the lines of communication and help employees achieve success.,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,hp

Although tolerable at first, it seemed like a variety of antisocial behaviors and ongoing harassment were commonplace and becoming worse to the point where I developed serious concerns with the ethics of the company. Based on my experiences towards the end I can't recommend anyone work for this company or support HP Inc. in any way, especially if you are differently-abled. I would not feel at all safe allowing my child to be an intern at the site I worked at and it scares me that people as young as high school age were being exposed to this environment. 

The workplace itself could be described as dingy, crowded, and cluttered which did nothing to help the generally poor environment. HP seems to have fully bought into the idea of a temporary workforce and what seemed like constant restructuring and employment thrash made this a particularly soulless place to be. The best, most talented, and generally nicest people tended to do their time and leave, to be replaced with ever-poorer quality people in a depressing race to the bottom.","Make some token effort to hire decent people.

They also treat you like an adult, and as long as you get your work done nobody is really clock-watching and you have flexibility to manage personal needs with business ones. I'm an old timer, going back to the Compaq days, and the current work environment is the best I have experienced in my 20+ years with the company.","No macro level cons, but as I am sure it is with any company, an individual job or role can have drawbacks: Some require extensive travel, since we are an international company some require calls at very odd hours, emergencies regarding product quality or supply issues can break out which can translate to very intense periods of long days until the situation is resolved. I'm sure there are some turd managers here and there, but from what I have seen they are not tolerated very long and get sorted out. But there are no overall ""Company Cons"" that come to mind (and keep in mind, I am an old Coot and usually pretty cynical, so for me to be this positive says something!).","Keep up the good work. Appreciate and support the movement to try to bring younger talent in the company, but be sure to continue to value and recognize wisdom and experience of your experienced employees. I would say challenge your mindset on what business we are in....it should not be viewed as the ""printers and computers"" business....we are in the ""image and information"" business and so developing new products/services/opportunities should flow from that mindset(e.g. people haven't stopped printing as many pictures...people have new ways to view images.

After about five years, it is usually time to move on to another company where you can have some assurance of more steady career paths.

Upper management strives to provide solid financial stability to the company.","Upper management treats the workforce as interchangeable cost units that can be moved from country to country. This means that you can be layed off (WFR) at a moments notice regardless of how talented or how much you contribute to the company. The depersonalization is such that people are not really called people by management they are called TCOW's(total cost of workforce -- permanent) and RCOW's (resource cost of workforce -- contractors). When the word comes down from on high to cut your TCOWs you have to do so regardless of how good the people are that are working for you. As you read the reviews you will notice a very different set of reviews depending which country the review is from.

Management creates quite a bit of PR about how they value talent within HP, but the lack of training and/or apprenticeship opportunities to develop people into new or changing roles is almost non-existent. It is pretty much limited to the occasional quarterly class on management processes or access to Linked-In learning. There is tuition reimbursement but it takes a serious commitment to a program before you can use it.

Volunteer programs / Classes / Employee events
Flexible work environments","HP has shown an increasing inclination towards outsourcing work to 3rd party houses or their China campus. Many jobs are being sent overseas while qualified Americans are being caught up in ""workforce reductions"".
There is no stability in HP. In the 10 years I was there I went through multiple restructures and mass layoffs. HP has a tendency to alternate between contracted labor and permanent employees with layoffs in between. 
If you are contract, be aware there is a forced 3 week unpaid shutdown during Christmas.
If you are perm, be aware that if you are caught up in one of HP's workforce reductions, there is a strict no-rehire policy. In my case, HP just purchased a new campus in Spring TX and was preparing to move to the new building. We were all assigned desks and I actually bought a house and moved my family closer to the new campus. Two weeks before the building move a large group of us were ""reduced"". We had all been given excellent reviews, the budget seemed fine, and the reason given was a need to ""refresh the talent pool"". We were given a severance package and 60 days (during a forced holiday shutdown) to find a job within the company. Since most of us were unable to obtain new positions that quickly especially during a forced shutdown, we are no longer able to work at HP either as contractors or permanent employees with no timeline restrictions. Take caution if moving your family!","HP is an American company that should invest primarily in supporting the American workforce. Please do not continue to send jobs overseas just to reduce the bottom line. We keep hearing about how great HP is doing as far as market share and finances but so many jobs that could be filled locally are not, all for the sake of the budget. 
I would also suggest reviewing the post-WFR no-rehire policy, especially considering HP's campus move to a much less central to Houston location.",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,hp

They pay well. They have great perks. At the beginning, life is good.

Facebook rewards ambition.","The appeal quickly wears off. Your experience at Facebook highly depends on the team you join.

Facebook does not have the best people managers. If you join a team with a good manager who knows the system, you will be more likely to have a productive, prosperous time at Facebook. If you join a team with a bad manager, your work-life balance will be horrible. You will feel extreme pressure with the Performance cycle review every six months. Worse yet, you may even blame yourself for what's happening, not realizing the role your manager plays until it is too late.

Facebook is a good company for new college graduates. Even with a bad experience, you can learn so much about practical, applied technology here. For those with several years of experience, or with family commitments, be careful. Come into Facebook with a clear sense of what you need from Facebook that you cannot get anywhere else. Be prepared to leave when that is delayed, or not a possibility, or comes at a cost to your family or external commitments.

For most people, Facebook is not a company that you join and happily work at for the rest of your life. Facebook is a temporary stop that will squeeze as much productivity out of you as it can. When that stops, it forces you out or makes you want to leave.",,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,facebook
4257,Tue Feb 16 2016 17:17:42 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time),,"Menlo Park, CA","Site Selection Program Manager in Menlo Park, CA",Pleasantly Surprised,I have been working at Facebook,408.0,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture: The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People: Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management: Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits: Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.","Keep doing what you're doing and fight hard to not be complacent. I believe that humility is the key so don't ever lose that thinking. Your motives will always be suspect, but if you're able to look in the mirror everyday and know that your motives are pure, that's all that matters. Walking the talk is the best evidence there is.",5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,facebook

- Super flat culture. Weekly Q&As with execs that are really open and casual, purposeful de-emphasis on titles. The emphasis is on ideas and impact; aspiring meritocracy
- Fast pace! Some view this as a con, but if you are high-energy and easily bored like me, this is ideal. Plus, this includes fast career growth. If you can perform, you will be rewarded quickly.
- Great people! ""Brilliant jerk"" behavior, as seen in these kinds of companies, is generally less tolerated/prevalent here than elsewhere
- Generally best engineering pay among big-tech employers


Less unique pros you've probably heard of (still awesome):
- Top-class benefits (including INSANE parental benefits)
- Amazing tech infrastructure, a great place to go very tech-deep
- Campus is basically Disneyland"," Recent newsmedia. It's easy to either feel discouraged or develop a bit of an ""us versus them"" mentality when the media/public seem both technically ill-informed and antagonistic towards your company.
- It's an increasingly mature company, which means the pace is (slowly) slowing down. This affects the culture; fewer people are mission-driven or down for a passionate ""hacker"" culture.","Keep up the [Mark's] recent push to ""take the offensive"" and evangelize the company's principles!

Rampant hostile political atmosphere
Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward. This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone. This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions. No one wins.

Sloppy processes
It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes. Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives). Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work. So much waste. No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations.

No humanity in the human facing part of the org
Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center. People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help. We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into.

Custom everything means sloppy everything
So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be! Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them.

Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people
Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period. It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience). The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook. It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly. There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops. There is only ""What's in it for me?"" 

HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock
You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position). I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details. Kind of disappointing. 

Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet
When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place. But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain. It's frightening given how much power and authority Facebook has and I really hope that this issue is sorted before things go to far.","Be mindful of what behavior you are driving given the way expectations are set
Take a hard look at what Facebook says it wants to do and what it's really doing- are they aligned?
For Community Ops- the org is there to support the users of Facebook- the humans on the other side. I'd encourage you to take a deep walk into the org to see if the individual members are really thinking of those people when they do their work.",3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,facebook

Not a good place for senior engineers joining. Too much stress in the team driven by performance reviews, which is the most aggressive that I've ever known. Emphasis is on individual impact, due to which there's lot of distrust within the team. No stack ranking, but a curve is implemented a org level. This is not a big deal in other companies but here it means 'out'. Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. 

There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication.

Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year.

This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired. Most of the engineers work to satisfy performance reviews. My work is determined keeping performance review as the guideline.

4293,Thu Sep 12 2019 13:48:01 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Senior Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",Current Employee ,Great company to work at - do not believe to different news,I have been working at Facebook full-time for less than a year,1.0,"I work in company for 6 months, but I like how company works and operates. One of policies is an openness - this includes famous weekly Q&As. Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. 

In general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news.

Work style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). 

There are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.","Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good. I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!), split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others.

Another minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area. It works well for young people, but for families with kids there are a lot of other factors to be taken into account, so Menlo Park area just doesn't work.",It would be good to have another campus in East Bay - somewhere in Dublin / Pleasanton area.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,facebook

My technical title was substituted with a non-technical ""specialist"" equivalent that paid less, resulting in a 20% bump in my salary when left, despite downgrading from a ""lead"" level position at Facebook to a ""senior"" level position at my current job.
* Management is often promoted based on seniority rather than competence.
* ""Most fast"" mentality leads to duplicated work, lack of documentation, and general confusion. Senior ICs are expected to spend much of their time project managing to make up for the failure in organization. I often found during requirements gathering for a project that part or all of it had already been done elsewhere and everyone had simply forgotten about it.
* The culture of open communication makes it seem like employee feedback is valued and encouraged, but actions are rarely taken on that feedback.

The above issues weren't as bad when I first joined, but my last year there was a nightmare filled with so much toxic stress and bad politics that I regularly broke down crying when I got home from work. On the other hand, I have friends elsewhere at Facebook who do the same job and love every minute of it. It all comes down who your managers and directors are.

- Impact. Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective.

- Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines.

- By default, almost everything you ship is used by a lot of people
- Benefits are really good"," You work all the time. It's impossible to truly step away from work. I had dreams about FB projects until about 3 months after I left.
- If you don't end up on a good team, or with a good manager, you're out of luck in terms of ""upwards"" movement and ""impact"". It's really a dice roll unless you're privileged enough to select a specific team.
- Facebook itself is a well greased machine. It self-enforces a lot of its own problems we're seeing the outcomes of today due to how it works. It's unlikely to change that anytime soon, so if you don't like how FB is unable to predict externalities in its work at its scale, you'll be upset working there
- Working at FB is a bit like having blinders on. You're so dang busy and shipping things all the time, it is not conducive for you to think about the big picture and (related to above) the potential butterfly effects/externalities of your work. Many well-intentioned projects end up having disasterous consequences, but I'm confident that 99% of people out there, if they worked on the project, would've also been unable to predict the fallout. The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render ""natively"" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface — it was lead by a product designer — and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money). If you ever met the Instant Articles design lead, you'd know all they care about is a good design and polished interactions. But it turns out, just caring about that means you aren't thinking about the potential damage your product can do 4 years down the line.","Facebook's culture will never change. The recent Q4 earnings are a testament to how good the ""ship fast"" machine is printing money. Even a disastrous 3 year long anti-FB PR cycle didn't keep the stock down for long, which means the company won't make major changes to the way they work.

Here are the more radical ideas that will never be implemented:
- Zuck needs to go, or step back into a different role to just focus on his pet projects (which he has many). His low EQ trickles down through the company because all important projects live or die by the ""Zuck Review"", which he offers his gut views on the product. The man is not infallible, and cannot predict bad human behavior because he himself (and those around him) are only human, and have many flaws and oversights due to their background, location, wealth, etc.
- Build more ""local"" product teams. FB to this day insists on running product from HQ, whereas Lays and Doritos know that their American flavors will never work in Southeast Asia and create local flavors with a local team and local testing. Line is a Korean company that has a Thailand specific team to work on Thailand specific features. Facebook has never done this except for a ""project Japan"" to make FB more appealing to Japanese people in the late 2000s/early 2010s.
- Fire a ton of people. There is a lot of incompetence, especially at the management level

The company works hard to look after its employees and provide them the best benefits and services. I have yet to see any layoffs. Even when jobs are eliminated Facebook provides assistance to find another position within the company. This is very different from my experience with Coca-Cola and CNN, both of which had regular large scale layoffs. Compensation is very good, especially for engineers.

- Can feel like Facebook values outside hires more than inside talent already there
- Many people do not get hired for roles in different departments or functions simply because they didn't do well on an interview, when they are more than qualified based on previous work experience at the company -- which isn't taken into account for hiring decisions. They weight internal/external folks the same. 
- work life balance is not great, but you don't come to facebook to ""Cruise"" if you do, you will be fired quickly 
- Newer PMs from other companies seem to be infiltrating a ""CEO"" role in their job -- which is not how Facebook operates. Collaboration > dictatorship of features and product. 
- The product specialist role specifically is challenging to stay in for longer than a few years -- the bar for performance gets higher, but you have the same ""quiver"" of tactics and tools and can only reinvent the wheel so much. 
- Many teams don't understand your role or respect it much, which is problematic because a lot of your impact comes from your ability to push changes and improvements through EMs, PMs and other product focused teams."," Allow internal candidates some advantages to changing roles or functions within reason -- we have the data and performance history to make the right decision. 
- Management needs more accountability. Anytime a project didn't ship or a team didn't do well, the leadership had a tendency to deflect blame on PMs, EMs and other ICs rather than leadership.

Our open culture is pretty amazing to understand the vision of our company and where we're heading.

While some of it may be deserved, a lot of it feels sensationalist. So employees have to develop a thick skin and resilience to a lot of this scrutiny and ensure that we are focused on the long-term, not just the short-term.

- Internal politics have drastically increased. There is a growing focus on optics vs. impact, which is incompatible with a culture that operates under ""Focus on Impact.""
- I found it difficult to express the company's values such as Be Bold and Be Open in a couple of organizations, because leaders who were external hires brought in a hierarchy, a ""CYA"" culture, and a combination of empire building and swim lanes.
- The culture in some organization is toxic – people feel unsafe voicing their opinions and being their authentic selves.
- Many teams find themselves blinded by metrics, still doing good work but missing the greater opportunities by ignoring clear paradoxes between metrics and customer experience.
- Internal transfer policies can be restrictive due to restrictions around leveling and performance. I know at least three people who left the company who wanted to move to a role that better suited them, but could not because they weren't meeting expectations in their current role (that didn't suit them)."," Spend time getting house in order – Build trust. Identify and remove toxic leaders throughout the organization, Meet with every employee to get pointed, specific feedback on team culture/management. Sure up buggy systems/processes before trying to launch the next feature or bring the next billion people on board.
- Don't attribute current political/data issues as the chief cause for employee attrition. The annual internal survey doesn't quite capture some of the cultural and operational frustrations that employees hold.
- Add more standardization to exit interviews – give them significant weight. This is an opportunity to learn the specific issues that are leading people to leave.

But are they worth selling your soul?","There is a lack of equity for how feedback and ratings are provided to black employees. Impact doesn’t matter, even if peer reviews during PSCs are phenomental; an inexperienced manager can say you did not meet expectations if they choose to rate the Growth areas higher than your Positive Performance.

While there is not official retaliation, managers can have their friends on a team retaliate against your work and impact. Facebook rates tenure over experience, so if you come in with ten years of senior industry experience, but someone has been in a junior role at FB for four years, that junior person’s feedback will be seen as more valuable than the dozens of thanks or recognition you receive cross functionally from other peers.

Black employees at Facebook are constantly treated as being less-than. Posts in Black@ and other groups have shown that White and Asian peers will assume you are janitors and ask you to clean up after their mess, or will cut in front of you, or other ask if you are a guest regardless if your badge is showing. Black people are Othered at Facebook. Your voice does not matter.

Outside of race, Senior people at Facebook are also leaving in droves. In one org specifically, there is lack of equity in pay, managers are under-trained and under-experienced, and there is no support for career growth.

The external media coverage is often dismissed. Facebook regularly says to press “we are sorry, but we will work to do better next time.” Internally, nothing is done, regardless of how many employees raise their voices on an issue.

If I had to sum up Facebook in one phrase, it’s “shut up and do your job.” If I had to sum it up for black employees, it would be “know your place.” And watch your back.","I would offer advice, but you will just ignore it.

If you're right out of college, this might be the place for you, but that's mostly because you wont have much work experience to compare it against.","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting:
 As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering. Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering. You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does. Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.

2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles. Also, be prepared for mansplaining.

3) more money than sense: gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around. there's basically an offsite every other week. Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing. The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.

4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers. no, seriously. say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away. you are kicked off the team and put on another team. what sense does that make? new mom wants to wfh? not allowed. 
 Seriously, it's called skype, people. 

5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack. instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project. a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project. This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.

6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken. I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly. bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix. seriously? why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?

7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance. no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom. What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE. Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why. But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise.","separate managers from IC. some of the best people I have ever worked for were not programmers.

stop focusing on impact, it sounds like a colon and its utterly meaningless

if it's broken, fix it. if your metrics change as a result, deal with it.

build a real team structure, and provide some actual leadership. 

focus on programming for real reasons. This stuff is far too random and scattered, and it gets abandonned 3 months after completion.

We're encouraged to be ourselves, there's no micromanagement, I feel like I'm free to fly as high as I want, they teach us how to have tough conversations, the management team is surprisingly open and forthcoming, the work is fulfilling and important and broadly impactful, the benefits are never-ending (as is the food supply), there's on-site everything– from haircuts to physical therapy to dental care, my coworkers are brilliant and outgoing and very much Type A, work-life balance is incredible compared to the start-up world, and that's just scratching the surface. It's a little shocking how great of a place to work Facebook is.","With 2.1 billion + users comes immense responsibility that it seems the management team was not fully unprepared to handle (see: Russian election meddling, fake/misleading news, Rohinga genocide in Myanmar, data breaches left and right, etc.). It's really tough to be reactively responding to issues of such mammoth import. That said, there's concerted, coordinated effort here to right the ship and get out ahead of these issues in the present and the future.","Prove that what you said when you were young and naive about growth and domination(!) at all costs is no longer the prime, sole focus of the company.

- endless food options
- global reach and impact

At Facebook, you have the opportunity to work on products that everyone uses. This helps you use and sharpen your skills in an entirely new way, and really think through your logic and decisions—unpacking every detail because you have to make sure it works and is understood across all demographics, countries, cultures, and languages.

They also take care of employees. Everything is free: shuttle rides, laundry service, professional development courses, tons of swag, and all the food, snacks, and drinks you can eat (the “Facebook 15” is real). The company’s health benefits are unmatched and they even have medical, dental, and gym facilities on campus."," politics and back channeling 
- competitiveness and lack of collaboration 
- relationships hold more value than quality work

Facebook the company is like the platform: everyone acts like everything is great, but no one acknowledges or exposes what’s really going on under the surface. People act like it’s all sunshine and roses, but because there’s such a “focus on impact” and performance, it’s actually a competitive environment where people are out for themselves and scrambling for whatever projects will give them the most visibility—at Facebook, visibility > impact > high performance ratings > bonus multipliers + equity refreshers. 

As a result, people you know and being an influencer matter more than the quality of your work. Likes are the real currency and even though you’re told to “be your authentic self”, one type of person benefits most: those who are extroverted, don’t rock the boat, and are oftentimes male.

While the actual benefits and perks are great, don’t be fooled by the glamour of it all: they’re also designed to keep you there and keep you working. You’ll be taken care of, but the focus on impact and performance makes it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. There’s an undercurrent of anxiety in the culture that is very real and not often acknowledged.

Facebook is a great company for those just starting out their career. If you’re a seasoned professional, I suggest staying away. It doesn’t matter how much experience or expertise you have—I spent most of my time proving to people half my age that I knew what I was doing. 

Time and again, my suggestions would be ignored or edited to the point that they were no longer my ideas. Time and again, leadership would be shown those watered down ideas and say, “Nope!” Time and again, when I’d go back to my original recommendation, leadership would say, “That’s the one!” After awhile, it was finally time for me to say, “I’m tired of (and better than) this.”","You hire people for their expertise, so let the use it. And when people bother to speak up, listen. Stop ignoring the problems and waiting for those people to burn out and quit. The number of people who go on medical leave is a signal.

They truly care about the well-being of their employees and that is evident in the number of perks and benefits given. It's a breath of fresh air from working elsewhere, especially in Chicago compared to other tech companies. The compensation and benefits are unparallel here. 

It's also the most inclusive office I've ever worked in or visited, you don't just hear about the importance of diversity, you see it. And why is that? Because Facebook is so deliberate about the way they grow and they make sure the representation of its community is reflected in its employees. 

Despite growing like crazy, Zuckerberg still does weekly chats with the entire company and there isn't a lot of hierarchy here among levels. Even though there has been a lot of negative press lately, there is a such a great level of optimism and forward thinking mentality that morale is still high.

- Adobe is a company built on acquisitions, and while the business strategy is usually rock solid, sometimes the comms isn't. It's tough to get any insight about what other business units are doing unless leadership gives a super high level read out during an all hands or there's a specific task that requires collaboration.

This is NOT that place. Adobe prides itself on its company culture and it shows tremendously through the leadership, its people, and its dedication to innovation. Some cool things about Adobe off the bat: they have a learning fund that encourages you to take classes, go back to school, or even go to conferences to help you develop in your career. There are a lot of on-site events for holidays, volunteer opportunities, and more so there is always something cool going on. Of course the wellness center is pretty awesome (and there are fitness classes you can take), and the food is pretty on point. 

One major thing that has been a refresher is that Adobe and the people who work here really put an emphasis on constructive and positive feedback: everyone here wants you to succeed. That energy carries throughout the workplace. You also feel very empowered to to help others as well, which creates this community and continuous cycle of trust, positivity, and communication. 

I will say this: Adobe is not for the faint of heart. ""Good enough"" isn't enough here. If you're okay with that, and you're an individual who likes to thrive, push, and succeed, then you will fit in just fine. There will be days where you will be putting in your time, and you'll have a 10 hour day. There are some days where you might leave a little early. What I will say is that you WILL take pride in the work you do, and nothing here is meaningless, at least in my opinion.","A work from home option would be nice, but I can also understand why they'd want people in office as it can be very hard to foster a work culture if employees are remote.",Keep doing what you're doing and continue to push the company culture! #AdobeLife,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,adobe

The workplace is nice--gym is top-notch, cafeteria is great, and other amenities make it an enjoyable work environment. I feel like the company, my manager, and my coworkers all support a solid work/life balance. Not only is there a lot of talent at Adobe, but there's an incredible amount of all-around great people and that makes work even more fulfilling. The company shutdowns (1 week off) at the 4th of July and at Christmas are AMAZING. Flexible PTO, sabbatical of 4-6 weeks every 5 years, $10,000 tuition reimbursement every year, four months paternity leave, 6 months maternity leave, employee stock purchase program with a guaranteed 15% ROI every six months, even if the stock dips. Several times when my family has gone to the dentist or doctor the offices are surprised at how great our health insurance is. There's also a decent amount of internal mobility that happens, so Adobe seems supportive of that.","This is hard...I've been with Adobe four years and it still feels like my dream job. Maybe one thing is that since Adobe is still growing so fast and acquiring companies, it can be challenging to learn so many new things and adapt to be able to support new directions and integration efforts.",Personally I would prefer that when we integrate companies we've acquired to maintain a bit more separation and let them do business as usual.

Especially the shutdowns in July and over New Year's are super valuable (it gives you a real mental break that you otherwise don't get).

(2) The company has a strong monopoly with the Creative Cloud, which brings in huge profits and took the stock price where it is now. 

(3) It is an amazing brand and working for Adobe makes you truly proud.","(1) Level of stress really depends on what product you work for. On the Creative Cloud side everyone is somewhat dispensable (it's a monopoly after all), which means it can be a pressure cooker and very political. How else to stand out?

(2) Given that work/life balance is so amazing, the compensation is a bit lower than elsewhere. I think it's totally fair but something to be aware of.

(3) On the Experience Cloud side, Adobe doesn't have the same level of experience as other companies. Adobe is not a traditional Enterprise software company, which means it's somewhat uneven.

(4) Kind of hard to make a career progression, given how nice the work/life balance is. Arguably it's better to make a career elsewhere and then join Adobe later on in your career.","Keep doing what you are doing.

The work environment is one where colleagues truly care about each other. It may sound simple but it's really motivating to be at a company where employees care so much about each other and the company cares about you- as a person not just another employee. There is also a mindset here where leadership is always questioning the status quo, pushing everyone to think bigger and differently, not get complacent, and to push for disruption if it will make us better. For a company over 30 years old and very successful, it's incredible to see and hear our leaders pushing for new ways of thinking so actively. There is no ""old vs. new"" guard that you might see at other companies. In addition to all this, the offices are gorgeous, comfortable, and creative. Food is excellent and subsidized a lot (not free which I like as there's no waste and less entitlement that what I've experienced at other Valley companies).","No real cons from a working perspective, I could get picky and say the elevators get crowded at lunch time and parking is tough if you show up to work late!","Keep up the mindset of being so welcome to new ways of thinking, fresh perspectives.

- Good pay and benefits for the area
- Good culture and lots of events
- Great company perks
- Great brand"," Lots of red tape in getting big initiatives pushed through
- Cramped office with people jammed into every corner of the building
- Office space designed for low profile walls to promote collaboration that really was more of a cost cutting initiative that made for a loud and distraction work environment
- Little movement at the upper echelons which prevented movement beyond Sr. Mgr or Dir
- Strong focus on hiring leaders from the outside instead of promoting within
- Low appetite for taking risks
- Lacking in ability for internal innovation that led, more often then not, to acquisitions for growth
- Certain departments were very hesitant to allow any formal work from home programs
- Recent high turnover in tenured employees due to internal drama and a culture that is starting to go down hill
- Unclear organizational leadership at the BU level
- Strong emphasis in diversity that over rotated to a negative bias towards over represented groups ie a perception that certain employees received promotions primarily because of belonging to an under represented gender or race. This includes an internal view by some that others are immune from termination because they fall in an under represented category even if those individuals were under performing",,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,adobe

They said they would train me and grant me some RSUs that vest in 4 years to convince me into making a long term commitment. Great!

I was initially on a centralized doc team full of writers and a manager *(the guy who hired me) and it was good. 2 years in, they decentralized us and all the writers were split up and put under product organizations. Okay cool. The product manager who became my new manager was a nice guy and a great product manager but had ZERO CLUE how to manage a writer and was mostly nonexistent and just cared that my job was being completed, which it was. This was because he had no idea what my daily duties entailed.

 Both my first manager of 2 years and my 2nd manager had nothing but top reviews and ratings to give me.

Then, the product I was working on got canceled and shipped to India. What did they do to the Jr Writer which they brought on, trained, and gave RSUs to convince him into making a long term commitment? They moved me to a new product, right? No, they just laid me off. Great manager reviews, total loyalty and commitment to Adobe, multiple product knowledge of several products across the cloud, and nope.... they just laid me off. 

A couple of my coworkers even complained up the ladder at how it was handled. But nothing changed. I was picked up by Microsoft a month later, but I still find how Adobe handled the situation very unsettling and unprofessional. They instilled a sense of commitment and loyalty into you... and so I ignored several other opportunities that knocked on my door--only to realize that was a mistake because Adobe didn't care about the commitment and loyalty they squeezed out of me.","Treat your employees like humans, not mere numbers.",1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,adobe

Isolation, 2. Offshoring.

Isolation 

Regarding isolation, this applied to me and my ""coworkers"", but I think others at Adobe were well-integrated with a team. So my experience in the group I worked in could have been unique. But small teams and geographically-distributed teams are subject to LOTS of isolation. In the 3+ years I worked there, I worked in three different physical office buildings, and moved my desk four times. I worked for four different bosses in three remote locations. Most of all, the people I worked with on a day-to-day basis were also geographically dispersed, and, with me moving around a lot, and other people sitting around me moving around, I never felt a sense of community. The people in the desks near me were not on my team and I didn't work with them. Often they were a bit stuck-up, or unfriendly, or from a sales culture that emphasized a ""dressy business casual"" attire for some reason, which was at odds with my more casual garb (despite the fact they were not customer-facing). Moreover, they had little interest in technical subjects, and therefore encounters were often awkward. I always felt under-dressed, but I had no reason to dress up in my role. 

Our group had lots of turnover, so there were constantly new and/or different individuals I worked with. I therefore felt physically isolated, and, a bit psychologically isolated because our team was relatively small and not well-known within Adobe and with customers.

Lastly, there was no good reason given for why I was moved around so much. I almost felt it was at the whims of facilities and/or management.

Offshoring
 
Adobe uses offshoring aggressively for certain teams and I'm not sure why. It didn't work in my department. Resources in India were poorly trained (if at all), stuck in their ways, very bureaucratic, and under the tight control of another managerial organization, so they had little, if any, incentive to work together or get ideas/insight from their counterparts in North America. Most importantly, I found most of my working time spent fixing or redoing a lot of work that was of poor quality that was previously performed by offshore resources. Offshore teams went through significant turnover, but were still firmly in place, even in positions of authority when I left, with a regular set of newcomers to replace people that had resigned or moved to another department. Offshore teams were often extremely slow and error-prone in their work, and often made very bad decisions about processes and tools that had very negative consequences.

Conclusion 

Adobe has lots of great people and products. Unfortunately, in my case, my team at Adobe suffered from much political ""power trips"", isolation, hierarchical, and top-down approaches, and ""upper level"" teams with ""carte blanche"". These people are self-proclaimed experts that will look down at you, always find fault with your work, give no thanks for the hard work and struggles that you do, and generally try hard to bully and make life miserable for you, simply because you are ""below"" them. 

Be careful working at this company. It's a big company, so others' experiences could be more positive. But mine and others were not so pleasant. If you work with offshore teams or in a small or little-known group/department, watch out. The fancy buildings, fancy food, and benefits are nice, but when you are isolated and not respected for your work, that negates all the good things at Adobe.",Seriously evaluate if offshoring is a good idea for certain teams. Don't just shuttle people from desk to desk and from office to office for no good reason.,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,adobe

Adobe is truly a great company to work for and it shows within the people that you work with. Everyone I've met is incredibly open and my experience so far has been great when it comes to being able to chat with any individual within the company that I am interested in learning from. 

I started off as an intern last summer and was able to return as a full-time employee and it has been great. The company really pushes for work-life balance and to work smarter than work harder. Upper management within my organization is really open to accommodating to talk to, although I know that one's experience in regards to that can vary based on your org. I'm super excited to be starting my professional career at Adobe and look forward to how my career will develop at this company.","Food isn't free, but it is subsidized and definitely worth what you're paying for. If it ever becomes free, that would be great! 

Also based on what I've heard from fellow interns, there is a lot of ambiguity in regards to intern to full-time conversion and I hope that experience would be more defined as I had a lot of my peers experience a limbo of being recommended to have the opportunity to return as a full-time employee but end up not receiving any offer. 

Can be a pro for some, but there is definitely a strong WFH culture and so the office can feel rather empty. Regardless, work gets done which is fine.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,adobe

I’ve had three managers, one of which was remote - the latter totally fine because we live in a remote world.

The irony is many of us teams work with colleagues in India but when we want to advance, US-based managers will not hire remote US-based employees.

Their customers always come first. 

For employees, the company has been doing extremely well with their Cloud offerings so the stock has nearly tripled in price in less than 3 years making a great ROI for employees that get RSUs. Pay is good/ average compared to other companies in the area.

Lastly, it's a great place to be if you're looking for flexibility and WFH opportunities. As long as you're doing your job and in the office for key in person meetings, they don't care where you work from.","If you are motivated and career driven, this is not the place for you. There is no CLEAR path to promotions. Most of the management/ Director positions are filled with external candidates and it is extremely difficult to move up unless you have an executive sponsor. Also, they don't conduct formal performance reviews which could be part of the problem.

Adobe often times prides itself in being one of the BEST places to work but HR works hard on these surveys and they are always asking employees to rate them well.

He even had a dozen years corporate experience with fortune 50 companies.

He apparently was amicable, diplomatic and passionate about joining Adobe and even had a creative background on top of his MBA. But because he didn’t quite fit the ‘profile’ he didn’t get it. Even when the majority of the interview team thought he was the one, but no. 

This is the type of hiring discrimination that stays in the shadows. The Adobe of yesteryear would’ve taken him and his passion.

Experts land here, and then are incentivized heavily to stay. Thus, if you're fortunate enough to be a junior engineer on a team, chances are good that you'll be surrounded by the very best in the industry to help mentor you. I've found my team to be humble, mature, accomplished, and eager to help me improve my skills.

- Because the engineers here are very much at the top of their game, it makes for a very uncompetitive atmosphere - they have little to prove and are very secure with their abilities. As a result, I've found the teams to be incredibly productive and collaborative.

- Adobe has a thoughtful business strategy. It is stable, focused, and driven. It doesn't get swept up in the typical flashy and silly hype surrounding much of the tech industry. It's fun to be part of this larger, sensible vision.

- I came here because the company placed a high value on ethics. Since I've been here, I've seen that these ethical standards are robust, and it makes for an awesome work environment.

- This is one of the few top tech companies that truly wants you to have a good work-life balance. Adobe understands that their employees perform better when they're not burnt out. Adobe understands that it's better to retain top talent and reduce churn than it is to constantly lose key team members and have to get new employees up to speed. This seems like a no-brainer strategy, but if you look at the industry retention rates, you'll see that few companies understand this.

- It's not a cult. I've not had anyone try to feed me kool aid. I really appreciate this, and probably would have gone elsewhere if this weren't the case. Even though I have a high opinion of the company, I've not ever really expressed this at work - it's simply not part of the culture to bleed for the brand or put on a show about how much you love the company.", I wish its brand were as sexy as some other tech companies.," Keep on keeping on, and so will I.

It does however have a single festering sliver that NEEDS to be pulled. Among the many pros of working at Adobe here are a few: elite/driven people, amazing products, fast innovation, positive global impact, and benefits that cant be beat. At one time there was endless growth possibilities.. that was until the sliver got there.","About two years ago leadership changes were made and a marketer was hired to run the Inside Sales Team. He openly admits that his only sales position throughout his career was a total failure. He claims to be data driven and relies heavily on his data guy. Both guys think the entire company can be driven on data alone, and not real world logic. That is basically the demise of everything that has happened since they both started. To his own detriment he has frequently ignored line management who know better. Every time there is push-back from line management it is likely ignored or those individuals are singled out and caught in his cross-hairs. Its very unfortunate because the managers are only making suggestions to better the company and strengthen the team.

They have cut territories, increased quotas, and hired a large staff of analysts to police the quality of work being done. This staff is being paid nearly a million dollars total per year to micro manage. Pipeline is starting to dwindle because of the lack of production due to unnecessary babysitting.

Morale has never been lower...","Pull the festering sliver! A management change is much needed for the Inside Sales Team, otherwise they will continue to experience high attrition. They need to be replaced with seasoned sales professionals who welcome team collaboration and unity. If Adobe is looking to save money it needs to reconsider the wasteful spending on this analyst team and remove it entirely. Lets Make Adobe Great Again!",3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,adobe
4854,Thu Mar 30 2017 22:59:18 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Inside Sales,"Lehi, UT",Current Employee ,Inside sales- circling the drain,I have been working at Adobe full-time for more than 3 years,15.0,"Good benefits, fountain coke AND pepsi machines, pearl ice, waterless urinals, free sunglasses, completely sealed gaps in bathroom stalls, natural landscaping, goats, a nice perch to look down on all the point product companies below.","Well.... if you are still reading this you must either be very bored and lonely, a recruiter (seriously guys... you are at a 9 with the Linkedin emails and I need you at a 4), a disgruntled previous employee making sure the grass didn't green back up...(pst... it didn't), perhaps a ""sales"" leader looking for a real opinion...

Or maybe you are a prospective new employee, eager to start your sales career and are looking to base a major career decision on a random, anonymous, TOTALLY unbiased online source (seriously millennials, don't talk to internet strangers). I direct my comments to you though (please take as many grains of salt as your parent's insurance-provided-doctor prescribes). 

You'll notice the other reviewers' chief complaint is with our Sr. dictat... I mean director... to summarize, he has no successful previous sales experience, has insulated himself with a thick layer of mid-level management, armed himself with a fleet of analysts, doesn't listen to any of his more experienced line managers, and targets people who challenge him then warns others to not ask ""career limiting questions."" He tries to come across as genuine but is basically a male version of Dolores Umbridge.

So how does a marketer take control of an inside sales organization? 

The key is to remember that most of the roles in this org involve finding prospective buyers and setting up demos for our sales team. There are a few roles where you work with an AE to close small deals but these are difficult to work your way into and frankly the juice isn't really worth the squeeze once you make it into that. So more than likely you aren't in ""Sales"" (from Adobe's perspective). Sure -- you are developing valuable skills for your future as a sales professional, and many very successful salespeople cut their teeth in this org, but from Adobe's perspective you are a lead generator (not unlike a marketing email, display ad, paid search term, etc). Ultimately, a cost of sales -- and costs are meant to be lowered -- which is exactly what the Sr. Director spends most his time on. 

That's how a marketer takes over an inside sales org. Because somebody who spends more time with spreadsheets then people thought they could lower cost of sales and manage people like a marketing campaign- while simultaneously preparing them for sales careers. 

Hopefully Adobe wises up, replaces top leadership with actual sales professionals who can groom the next generation, and stop the hemorrhaging of great sales talent leaving in droves. 

That being said, maybe you will be the transfusion to replace the lost life blood of inside sales... About 15 spots have opened up and there are a lot more coming soon (like empty first class rooms on the sinking Titanic). Just go in with your eyes open, get Adobe on your resume and then have an exit strategy.

Most of the organization understands the value of flexibility. Jerks are largely clustered under leaders hiring more jerks. 

It's a good company. Experience will largely depend on which organizational and leadership group you are in. They have some good mid-level leaders and some aggressively sub-par ones who drive their employees too hard, but probably don't see as much attrition as they should because the company culture and benefits are good overall. 

Most of the mid-level management privately express concerns about how intensely we've hired in India, how they are blocked from hiring elsewhere, how challenging it is to find staff with a mindset of attention to detail, quality work, and an understanding of how to communicate internationally. They are generally afraid to communicate this to executives. Key executive positions are held by talented Indian leaders who do not appear to understand the extent of these cultural difficulties in hiring at an individual contributor level. Back office and IT are largely a mess because UX focus has been customer-centric for so long, and many small development mistakes have been introduced into systems. Leadership and hiring there could be improved as the complexity of the environment increases.","Most groups need tools and ideas to better manage the volume of meetings and emails consuming people's time. Open work environment increases collaboration and team bonding, in some cases, but reduces productivity as people find it difficult to maintain flow, or abandon their cubicles to find quiet spaces and less movement, despite a desire to work near their teams.","Help your employees get more effective work done. Fix the back office employee experience and systems through better tools, automation, ideas, and/or hiring. And reduce the amount of inexpensive manual labor you are throwing at the problem long term. Large, complex challenges can usually be fixed through intelligent collaboration, clever ideas, targeted and better hiring in leadership. Develop, research, or better disseminate the correct best practices. Where system complexity is high, temporarily spend the time/effort getting leadership (or heaven forbid consulting) in the top 1% in these key areas, rather than the top quarter. Further develop processes and culture that allow the best ideas to pass through the environment rather than layers of leadership.",4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,adobe

Comp package, benefits, employee stock plan and the #AdobeLife is elite. ""I Don't Like it, I Love It,"" by Flo Rida and Robin Thicke wrote this jam about Adobe.","Only one problem: Inside Sales leadership. There are no leaders in management, though they have the titles, they cannot do their jobs because their leader appears to be dishonest, condesending and threatened his entire org during the most recent all-hands meeting, to not ask “career limiting questions,” regarding their quotas going up 40% to 125%. Any managers that challenge his ideas are pushed out. His pride is killing Inside Sales at Adobe.

Employees aren't heard, valued or respected. Twelve (12) from Inside Sales have left in the past month, but whats scarier is the amount of people actively looking. When it==the max exodus occurs they won’t care, but they won’t even see if coming because they think all is well in Zion. There are many more that will be gone by the Summer. Our leadership actually reached out to another local company that hired some of the Adobe employees, and demanded that company end existing interviews with all Adobe employees. The evdence is the emails that company sent to the interviewing Adobe employees. HR violation or not, that’s how this leadership behaves. They don’t listen and they think they can solve problems, but with no sales leaders in upper management they often misdiagnose the problem and the solutions just compound problems. This is not just a Lehi problem as two from San Jose left in the last two weeks. Our leadership will handpick specific people and situations and use that best case scenario as the typical example of how things should work every single time.

Leadership has raised quota 4 times mid-year in the last 22 months. Once you hit your number, they move the number back then brag about how they removed the cap that the last leader had. We miss that guy. After one such quota change they retroactively took money from an entire team of ADMs, totaling thousands per ADM. Retroactive folks! He has taken away entire revenue streams, not paid out spiffs, forced ADMs to compete against the field team and doesn’t provide cover over the top when we attempt to execute his plan against our field teams. We have “new quality standards” that are simply just busy work for him to report up some awesome new changes. All of this would be fine if we were being compensated properly to deal with his drama, but production has fallen off a cliff and he bragged that gives him more credibility as a leader. He may be delusional, narcissistic or just threatened by A+ players. I will admit, I’m not a doctor. I have heard comparisons to Lord Farquad, but I have not seen the movie Shrek, so I cannot comment. During our company Christmas party one of the white elephant gifts was rolls of toilet paper with his likeness custom printed on the ultrasoft. Many fought over that gift. During one exit interview he was called out on his threat to the org regarding “career limiting questions” and he denied ever making that comment. He forgot its recrded and that it was attended by nearly 150 people. It’s also cute that he personally posted a positive review of the great job he’s doing here at Adobe, lol. Now he has the other Inside Sales managers posting positive reviews on Glassdoor. Now you know you’re desperate…","Focus on us and not the field sales team. Fix our org problems. Every new change is for the field and not your own org (TBP, Value Prompter, Auditor team). Just save face and fix our problems. We don’t need or want an apology because we don’t value public perception over production. With your Director title, you are accountable to fix it. No one is right all the time and we don’t hold it against you until you start lying and talking to us like we’re children. Don’t tell us that it’s a good thing that our quota doubled and then tell us we’re being recognized as a high performer when you give us a 20% quota raise tax on top of everyone else on our team.

Their lack of experience shows and is only compounded by high school-like bonding/favoritism of individuals off their teams. Be ready to join many pointless happy hours to become well-liked by your manager... or suffer being handed a bad territory of accounts. 

If you're an experienced salesperson, it may not be the best company. The company is product-centric, not sales and service-centric. Means you will spend a lot of time working around the nuances of administrative tasks like billing issues, contract creation, customer service (virtually nonexistent Customer Success team), navigating the outdated CRM process, creating client presentation collateral (subpar product marketing team), broken dashboards, etc. 

The best way to be successful is get a lucky account/territory that is bound to grow a lot or simply put your head down and take ownership to work through all the sales productivity gaps. Important to note that there is a ""sales productivity"" team, but nobody knows what they do and there is zero way for the sales organization to provide feedback to help improve the very apparent issues. 

Overall, if you want to have flashy Instagram posts and free beer on Thursdays, LinkedIn is an amazing place to work.

Truly believe upper management leads with compassion and transparency which is evident in company decisions, communication, and does trickle down the corporate ladder effectively.","Horrible middle management. Good to great sales reps do not always equate to good management. I left the company due to a continued negative experience with both my direct manager and management within my organization and saw little response and action from our Director to address said challenges. While there will always be disagreements and personality mismatches, I am confident that I am not the only one who shares this viewpoint given the 50%+ attrition within our direct org. The sad part is that the team I was on was not at as bad as other teams within our organization led by first time managers who cannot relate to people and were not a top performing rep prior to moving to management.

I (and others) began losing faith in the company as a whole when feedback given at time of the EVS, along with skip level conversations, were never acted upon and inappropriate behavior continued to persist on a daily basis. 

Having been with the company for quite a few years leaving was not easy. But when you mix in inconsistent quality in middle management, along with an ever-growing belief that the louder, ""Cheerleaders"", on the floor are the only ones getting support from management, you have a toxic situation that has led to people leaving, in masses.","Listen to your direct reports. Don't stop at listening, actually act before all of your mindshare leaves in the next 2 months. Listening is great at first, but when nothing changes after a few months, efforts of gaining feedback are seen as nothing but insincere corporate jargon.

This is a high turnover company. Account Executives are constantly in and out with no way to move internally. 

In the last year I have seen 6 very skilled sales people leave due to high quotas, poor leadership, and not being able to move up in the org. Every team from time to time will have a ""plus one"" on their team. This person is there to help the team while another person is put on plan for not hitting their quota. While this is set up to be a learning role it ends up being a reminder that someone is there to take your spot at anytime. 

Account Executives did make a lot of money when quotas were attainable, but with the Microsoft Acquisition quotas went up and more people were hired. This created less opportunity for everyone and it doesn't look to be slowing down. 

The Role: 
This role is a Sales Development role primarily. You will spend most of your day prospecting out of an excel doc. 

The sales process is easy. The tools sell themselves and you just need to find the people who can afford this solution. 

Leadership: 
There is a a lot of time put in to learning and developing. If you are lucky to have a manager who has been here a while you will get a great learning experience. If you have a new manager this is going to be much harder. Most of the people who have left have had new managers who weren't properly trained to develop people or work with them.

The Right Fit: 
Currently in Sales Development or SMB sales and killing it. You are used to a high quota and a transactional sale. Maybe you have some customer service experience as well. This will come in handy as you do need to hand hold clients and get them using the products correctly. You are not looking to move up while at the company and know going in that you will have the same role for as long as you are here. Expect to make 80K/ year all in",Hire managers who have sold a similar tool and could sell it themselves. If a manager can't sell the product they can't coach their team to do it. Anyone can write e-mails congratulating the team or reminding them of KPIs.,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,linkedin

4973,Wed Jan 02 2019 15:17:01 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Product Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Business Product Manager - Sales Productivity Operations,I worked at LinkedIn full-time for more than a year,34.0,"LinkedIn:

- Benefits are great. Free healthcare, food, unlimited PTO
- Top talent; very smart and engaging professionals
- Industry leader with sizable market share
- Beautiful offices with snacks, great conference rooms etc.
- Incredible mission statement and enterprise wide supported objective to provide economic opportunity to the entire global workforce
- Top of the line senior executives. Jeff Weiner may just be one of the best CEOs in the country

Sales Productivity Operations:

- Front line employees (Associates, BPMs, etc) are incredible people. Smart, easy to work with, collaborative and goal oriented
- The ability to streamline and improve the sales experience is a leading edge position
- Horizontal in nature therefore you are exposed to several LOBs and other sales focused teams","LinkedIn:

- From a talent and recruiting perspective, the company is overly focused on individuals with brand names on their resume... Many talented professionals are ignored because they didn't attend a certain university or work at an industry leading firm prior. Additionally, there appears to be a very large emphasis on hiring young and avoiding older applicants
- Young, aggressive and somewhat political. You'll never escape corporate politics, however due to the target recruiting demo, political posturing and in-authenticity is fairly prevalent as young professionals are looking to make big moves early in their career. Major power brokers are usually people who are able to navigate the political landscape seamlessly which typically requires a person who is unafraid to self promote while stepping on peers in the process. In addition, self recognition is encouraged and creates a weird, tacky non stop elevator pitch that you see bleed over onto the platform
- Over diversified product. Way too many irons in the fire which dilutes the effectiveness of the product which provides a platform experience that is 'meah' when it should be revolutionary. The focus seems to be oriented towards a jack of all trades master of none approach
- Pay is slightly below mean for the industry

Sales Productivity Operations:

- Poor leadership. Whoever established the Sales Productivity Operations (SPO) org (still very new org) appointed leaders with pedigree and really impressive resumes. Unfortunately EQ and leadership abilities were completely overlooked. Point of fact, one key leader has had countless HR complaints and has weekly coaching sessions on how to better connect with people... At this level, these skills should be table stakes, not something you have to coach and coax. Interactions with some of the key leaders range from 1 on 1s with eye rolls, frequent interruptions, excessive phone usage while others are talking, laughter at suggestions, belittling in front of peers and micromanagement to the Nth degree. Put simply, the key leaders inside of SPO are a complete nightmare to work for. When you tell people who you work for outside of the org, the reaction is typically the same - empathy and offers to help facilitate inner company transfer.
- Toxic environment. As a result of the leadership, Product Managers are not encouraged to think or act independently. Strategy and execution are both dictated to you. Retention reflects the environment as the org has trouble keeping butts in seats longer than 6 months. As an example we had a top tier Senior Manager who decided to leave after 6 months, mainly because they were miserable working for SPO leadership.
- Over reliance on the consulting skill set. Since SPO leaders have top 3 consulting firm experience, there is an over reliance on getting people in from similar a background. As a result, it creates an echo chamber and a superficial problem solving modality - throw it on a slide, use some of that sexy consulting jargon and move on. Thought and strategy that approach the root of an issue or objective are not encouraged. This in effect, impacts the output of a diverse workplace as it does the opposite of what is intended - creates group think.","I am willing to admit that myself and my fellow co-workers in SPO likely had a very unique experience, not akin to what the true culture of LinkedIn is championed to be. That being said, after all of the complaints, the blatantly poor talent retention data points and employee voice surveys that suggest SPO employees are not very happy, I am disappointed that business continues to be conducted as usual. Someone in a position further up the latter has to be remotely aware of the issues and is either unable or unwilling to make a change. 

Direct message to senior GSO leaders: You have the info at hand. Don't let ineffective leaders railroad efforts to create an inclusive and enjoyable environment that LinkedIn strives so hard to instill. Numbers don't lie. Look at the retention issue and employee voice survey results.",3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,linkedin

4987,Sat Dec 22 2018 22:45:06 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), Account Executive,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,It is a disservice to give anything less than 5 stars.,I have been working at LinkedIn full-time for more than a year,9.0,"To start, I should first mention that I have never written a Glassdoor review for any company I have worked for, but I had to make an exception - you'll see why. Before I begin my review, I should first give some background about how I landed at LinkedIn.

I quit my previous job out of sheer disgust of how poorly run an organization it was. It was a company that had leadership with poor transparency, an antiquated product, and a poor career growth outlook.

As I was considering my next step, I found that I had two job offers at the same time: One from LinkedIn and another from a startup. I spent hours and hours going through Glassdoor reviews of LinkedIn, weighing the pros and cons of joining a large company vs a smaller company. At first, I was leaning heavily towards the startup- it's the dream isn't it?? You get in when it is a small size, get promoted more quickly as the company grows and cash out big. 

That's the dream at least. Although I plan on joining a startup one day, most of my friends who are currently working at a startup will tell you that the reality is that most startup careers don't follow that journey, for one reason or another. As I approach my one-year mark at LinkedIn I look back at my decision to join LinkedIn as the single greatest decision I have ever made in my entire professional career. Period.

Why? Let's start with culture. This is a company that has, despite its large growth in headcount over the last few years, SOMEHOW managed to maintain an extremely positive, friendly, energetic, and downright FUN culture that is BETTER than most startups. It goes SO strongly against the stigma of a mundane, lifeless, corporate vibe that I always incorrectly assumed engulfed companies as they get larger. Boy was I wrong there... End of quarter is literally amazing. I closed a deal, spun a wheel, and won my entire team a round of mimosas. On my way back to my desk I passed a cart with people handing out food and blasting celebratory music. 

Second and most importantly: When you join a startup, your growth is limited, for the most part, to the effectiveness and competency of the one VP/manager you work for. When you speak with LinkedIn employees, you will constantly hear talk about how incredibly high-caliber and intelligent every employee and manager is that works there. LinkedIn is selective. And the sales managers at LinkedIn are legitimately some of the best sales minds on the planet. More time-tested managers, combined with world-class peer talent means one thing: more readily available collaboration to bolster your personal and professional growth. 

Third: Perks. The treatment I receive makes me feel like royalty. I get a freshly catered, free breakfast every day, a freshly catered free lunch every day, an in-house barista who makes me an amazing latte every day, and a kitchen stocked with literally everything. Oh and I forgot - FREE health insurance. Yup. FREE. In addition, $2,000 EVERY YEAR of flex dollars you can spend towards wellness (gym memberships, personal trainer). LinkedIn always has your back and has you covered... And I can also tell you that when you get treated like a serious professional, you start working more and more like a serious professional. I can go on about the perks, but I think you get the idea.

Fourth: Best-in-class leadership. Witnessing this has been such a relieving contrast to the poor leadership I experienced in my previous company. Leadership does everything right. If there is a new policy they make and they hear negative feedback, they make adjustments and do so transparently. When things are going well revenue-wise, they use it effectively to boost morale. If there is a stretch of things not going well revenue-wise, they remain positive, they remain professional, and they always succeed in helping us keep the bigger picture in mind.

At the end of the day this is a company that does everything right. Their attention to achieving excellence in every last detail of every part of the business, from culture to operations to coaching to feedback loops to employee recognition - is unparalleled to anything I have ever seen. Shame on anyone giving LinkedIn less than 5 stars.","My biggest hesitation in joining a larger company was stagnated career growth. I was worried it would take me years and years and years to get promoted compared to a startup. Biggest irony, fast forwarding one year, is that I could care less. Why? Because of all the reasons outlined above, I am so focused on being better at my current role and continuing to grow, my title is the last thing on my mind. I'm not seeking a promotion because after being exposed to so many talented reps, I realize that I'm not ready! And that's fine. Makes me wonder how many unqualified people in startups get promoted even when they have gaps in their selling abilities, and then teach newer, impressionable reps suboptimal ways of selling as a result...

In approaching my one year mark, I have not been promoted, but I haven't viewed that as a con. Longer promotion time is what you sign up for when you join any larger company, but what is considered a ""con"" to some people, doesn't really matter to me.",Change nothing.,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,linkedin

- Lots of mediocre middle-management bloat: Linkedin clearly promotes people who have been at Linkedin for 3+ years to prevent them from leaving. Unfortunately, these people usually fall into one of two categories: (1) cares about you and means well but puppet of upper management or (2) only interested in management for their career growth and don't care about yours. 
- Extremely top-down culture: leadership pushes their ""vision"" and promotes mercenaries to execute exactly how leadership wants. This is particularly true within the free consumer app teams, whose ""vision"" generally consists of copying one of 3 apps: Reddit, Facebook or Instagram.

I made lifelong friends and family at LinkedIn. I believe LinkedIn has the best of intentions when it comes to the Employee Resource Groups that promote diversity and inclusion. Overall the leadership is incredible and Jeff is an inspirational leader. I loved that LinkedIn was always thinking 5 steps ahead and always thinking about how to innovate their products.

Amazing benefits and compensation! The benefits across the board were incredible from 401k, stocks, health, wellness and perk-up, as well as mat/pat leave.","While innovation is wonderful, you can't forget about the products that got you to where you are. I don't feel that resources were adequately aligned to older product lines in the talent solutions space. Constant site outages and product issues with Recruiter and Jobs.

-Quotas are ridiculously high and difficult to hit especially in the talent solutions space. There are HUNDREDS of competitors and though LinkedIn has a great product, the competition is gaining traction. This should be accounted for in quotas. Be prepared to sell against a lot of companies and to lose budget to newcomers like ZipRecruiter/Muse. 

-You will maintain the same book of accounts which is great for building relationships with customers however your quotas will still rise even if your book is tapped.

-There is no work life balance, too many product trainings, middle management is wishy washy and there is little to no consistency across the board with performance standards.

-Tenured upper management resigned consistently the last few months I worked there which to me was concerning. There was no room for them to grow and the culture changed from what it once was.

-Lots of red tape since being acquired by Microsoft but thats to be expected.","I was lucky to have some great managers at LinkedIn but that's it...I was lucky. Had I been on a few other teams, I would have left a lot sooner. Your sales managers are the backbone of your organization and if you hire sales managers that have no experience selling LinkedIn, it's difficult for them to understand why their teams might be missing their quotas and be able to coach a struggling rep. 

Remember that LinkedIn is NOT the end all be all. It's unrealistic to think that customers would only allocate budget to LinkedIn (I'm not kidding, this conversation was brought up a multitude of times). Often sales management's response to losing budget would be that we weren't selling our value prop well enough. There are hundreds of companies entering the talent landscape and it's extremely difficult to sell against these other companies that have offerings at a lower price with equal results to LinkedIn. 

While I understand it's important to increase quota, it's also important to consider that a large percentage of your sales reps aren't hitting goal. I believe that should be taken more seriously when assigning annual quotas.

Get more clear on your performance standards and what would put an RM on a plan or not. Your teams are consistently scared for their jobs.",4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,linkedin

Important positions will be staffed based on the university the employee graduated from, rather than work experience. Sales process is being created by recent Ivy League grads who have never sold. Some sales and service director positions have been filled with individuals who are extremely smart but have limited to no experience selling and retaining. The attitude is if you are smart, you can lead any team no matter if you have zero experience doing your staff's actual trade. 

The millennial focus is highlighted in many aspects of the culture. At the 2016 global sales organization meeting, messaging was all about ""you are the best-of-the-best"" and that LinkedIn would not be successful without the individual job you do. Top performers were highlighted in front of thousands of employees. As the employee came to the stage to receive their well deserved award, videos of colleagues commending them were shown. Interspersed among work-centric kudos, the awardee's parents were shown in the videos congratulating their child and stating how proud they were of them.

If you are Asian or Caucasian, it's very likely that you'll experience the same reverse discrimination I faced during my time at LinkedIn. I sat through countless ""diversity"" talks and felt increasingly excluded from LinkedIn's hallmark ""inclusive culture."" At LinkedIn, there's a stark difference between invisible diversity and celebrated diversity. The celebrated diversity here is race.. the invisible diversity here is socioeconomic status, sexuality, academic background and age. LinkedIn will shove a narrative down your throat that encourages you to feel immense guilt and shame if you're a ""privileged race."" News flash, being Asian doesn't mean I'm automatically privileged. 

Not surprisingly, this leaks into your opportunities for great projects and promotion. I was told by management to underperform towards my quota-carrying role because it promoted unhealthy competition against less privileged teammates - in that case, salary me and I will happily underperform.

Speaking of salary - don't expect to make a high one here. They consistently underpay the market because they want ""people who love LinkedIn for the opportunity and not the money."" I'll never forget the number of entry-level hires that told me they were working Uber, Taskrabbit, or depending on their parents to afford to live in the city.",Pay a fair market rate ... invest in your talent.. start thinking about diversity more dynamically,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,linkedin

The BLP program scams college students every year, promising interesting projects and career development. This program is glorified sales funnel. The recruiters will tell you that you have the career mobility to work for a non-sales team and even convert full-time to marketing, operations, or talent strategy. However, this is less than 10% of each class. You'll be pressured to move into a sales team for a full-time offer as well as threatened to be moved unwillingly to Chicago (their sales hub). In Sales Development, you'll do the same thing over and over, 100+ times a day, every day. All the Sales Dev associates are extremely burnt out, bored, and unengaged. The only thing that keeps the sales machine going is LinkedIn's larger company culture. The compensation reflects how much the company values you... and most associates are supported by their parents because they cannot afford SF rent on the salary. If you want to keep great, top talent... give them interesting projects and the opportunity to have a meaningful impact on the company.

- Workplace Perks (onsite coffee bar, multiple cafeterias, amazing chefs, gym + exercise classes, great facilities, snacks/drinks/fruit/etc) 
- Commuter Benefits (free CalTrain pass, shuttles) 
- Flexible work schedule -- a lot of managers do not sit in your office (obviously, depends on the organization you are in) so they are flexible about WFH as long as you are performing your job
- Salary is decent (not the most competitive or the highest.... but it's offset by all the perks you get from the company)"," For a company that is in the talent business - helping people find jobs -we are really bad about internal movement to different organizations/roles. It's extremely difficult, and there is no bias towards internal candidates. They essentially want someone who already has done the job vs looking at transferable skills and keeping talent at LinkedIn. It's a real bummer, as this is a key reason why great talent have left LinkedIn to pursue their dream job at competitor companies that were willing to ""take a chance"" on them.
- A lot of ""high performers""/""high achievers"" have left the company, so the leftover employees are mostly there just to do their job and go home. Not that this is necessarily a CON - but just something to point out. If you are looking to really learn and grow - fast - this is not the place for you.

I have worked at other tech companies and I can say that this company spoils their employees with some really great perks and there are a few things I like about working here such as:

-Amazing health insurance for my family
-PerkUp credit to be used annually on a number of pre-approved items (gym membership, massages, child care, home cleaning)
-Free breakfast/lunch/snacks 
-Opportunities to travel (if that's your thing)
-Women in management positions 
-Working for a well respected brand 
-Discretionary time off
-Awesome maternity/paternity leave policy
-Pay is above average","The downside of working at LinkedIn is that I quite literally have to sacrifice my work/life balance and sanity for the perks mentioned above.

-Onboarding did not prepare me at all to work at LinkedIn or my role
-Very little training for new hires. You are thrown in and expected to just figure it out.
-Poor communication across teams in multiple offices
-Long hours (although they will blame it on your lack of time management)
-My particular team is incredibly difficult as a working parent 
-DTO is nice but missing days does nothing but hurt you
-Even when I am not working, I'm constantly stressed about work
-Everyone made a big deal about InDays when I started as a day that you can take off and focus on the theme of the month but my team does not participate.
-My role is more of a sales position than a customer success position
-Doesn't feel like there are many opportunities in the Chicago office to grow

The culture on my team is very different than what I have heard at large at LinkedIn, which is unfortunate, as I feel like I have a very different perception of the company. From my first week of training, I felt that coming here was a mistake because I was forgotten about and not prepared to do my job.

I left a very enjoyable job that did not pay as well to come to LinkedIn and it feels like I have given up my peace of mind for more money. Not a great feeling.","Make sure your employees feel prepared before putting them on the phone with clients

Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive. 

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true. 

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :(","1) Don't dismiss emotional intelligence and adaptive leadership. They're not just catch phases. You need great managers and leaders in order to build great companies and develop great employees. The people who may be brilliant at solving technical issues may not be (and are most often, not) the best candidates for management. 

2) Do something about that work-ife balance. Don't just have a bunch of pow-wows and tech talks and discussions about it. Leadership should actually model it. Consider re-evaluating how work is done; what processes are in place that are inefficient and ineffective and need to be updated or removed? 

3) Don't forget that there is already a pool of incredibly talented people within the company. If career development is really a goal at Google, then do it. Don't just hire from the outside. Take the time to help your employees develop their careers - then maybe you won't lose some of the great ones, and maybe you'll have prevent some of that burn out and disillusionment.",4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,google
5167,Sat May 10 2014 14:46:38 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Software Engineer III,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,"Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects",I have been working at Google full-time for more than a year,986.0,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",Keep the focus on the user.

5168,Sun Feb 08 2015 00:41:18 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time),,"Mountain View, CA"," in Mountain View, CA",The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.,I have been working at Google,560.0,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning. No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you. Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge. I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.","Keep on NOT micromanaging - that is a huge benefit to Google. Most of us have a huge workload and we work in spikes and not chained to our desks, and we care deeply about producing, and we produce a lot.

Thus, Google was designed for those who thrive in academia. Also, yes, Google does operate and feel like a big corporation; with all the rules, processes, red tape, etc you'd expect from a big corporation. This combination is a nightmare for anyone with ADD/ADHD.

As far as the Software Engineering role is concerned; nearly everything at Google is built in house and there are libraries that try to solve every problem you'd ever have. What this means is;
 1. You'll spend a lot of time re-learning most of what you already know
 2. These ""do-everything"" libraries, in addition to adding non-sensical complexity, take from you the interactive and fun part of building software and replace it with poorly written guides.

The majority of a Software Engineer's time will be spent digging through code and lengthy guides, with relatively little hands-on programming. If you have ADD/ADHD, please seriously consider the above before accepting a Software Engineer role.","1. Stop advertising positions as requiring creativity and outside the box thinking when the primary role responsibility is trying to make sense of over-engineered software and poor but lengthy documentation.

2. Perform an internal study to define the breath of learning styles (not just in Google, but in the industry) and define changes that need to happen to make internal guides *universally accessible and useful* to those of us who have non-traditional learning styles.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,google

From the amazing perks like unlimited food, to free transportation to work, to everything in between, the company really does have everything you could want from a benefits package.","The downside of having all of this, is that you attract the worlds best colleagues. Seemingly you would think this is a good thing, and while to a degree it is (pretty much everyone I work with is outright brilliant), the repercussions of this are far greater than you would initially assume. Imagine the most type A, overachieving folks in your old college classes. You know, the ones that will literally go way above and beyond to do a truly exceptional job (chances are if you work at Google you were one of those folks). Now imagine only the top 1% of all of those people are in one place at the same time. Now think about what happens to the culture when you put all of those folks together and keep hiring them as your company scales. Suddenly everyone is taking on the max possible amount of work and doing the equivalent of 3 people's workload, and then that becomes the norm for everyone. And no one will ever complain about it because at the end of the day everyone wants to be a team player and never say no to a request, regardless of the time commitment. This leads to everyone working long hours, working on vacations, and even while sick. 

To make matters worse, your manager is probably the same way. Since Google will hire a director from another company and make them a manager at Google (because Google is so big a director's scope of work will be similar to that of a manager at Google), chances are your direct manager has the ambition of a top preforming senior leader. And while they are likely to be very nice (for example my current manager is absolutely amazing) , they will set your workload based on your peer's workload since the average assumption is that if the others on the team can do it, why can't you?

Put this all together and you quickly have folks burning out left and right, and consequentially a very low average tenure for your team despite people loving their core jobs. It quite sad really because everyone I know in my Org is very happy outside of the amount of burnout they feel. 

Another important note is that it takes forever to get promoted at Google because regardless of how good the quality of your work is, you have to compete against colleagues who generally speaking are willing to do whatever it takes, and make any life compromise necessary to get promoted.

Overall, I think Google is a well intended company, with well intended employees that sadly have fell victim to losing their own culture through scaling and hiring the best.","Be consciousness of what example you are setting for your directs . It is completely okay to be ambitious and hard working, but understand that type of workflow isn't sustainable over long periods of time. Very few people want to leave the team because they are unhappy, most leave because they simply are burned out and have already given everything they can to the team.

We love Google, but it has to be a team effort to keep making it a wonderful place to work as we continue to grow.",4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,google

5302,Wed Oct 09 2019 11:30:41 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Staff Software Engineer,,Current Employee ,An impressive roof over rotting rafters,I have been working at Google full-time for more than 3 years,8.0,Compensation and perks make for a materially comfortable environment,"Don't believe the glowing reviews. The company may seem fantastic if you're a fresh graduate who's still overawed by free food and on-site laundry. But once you reach the higher levels, you'll realize that the company has become a cloying, insular, and claustrophobic place. Internal technology falls further behind the outside world every day, but people still speak and act like they did when Google was years ahead of everyone else. It's an environment of total hubris.

God help you if you try to rock the boat. If you do, people snipe at you in design documents, slander your work and your mannerisms behind your back, and undermine you in performance reviews, all the while presenting just enough of a friendly facade to maintain plausible deniability. Nobody will tell you what's really going on. Very few people are interested in technical excellence. The joke is that Google hires the smartest people to ""move protos"" (i.e., do drudge work) all day. It took me years to realize that the ""move protos"" meme resonates because the L7-L9 old-time clique comes down like a fist on anyone trying to do more than make uncreative, incremental, and low-impact changes.

Maybe you don't care about technical excellence. If you don't, you won't be alone: ""merit"" and ""heroism"" are dirty words at Google. Maybe you want to work your 10-4 job, land a few CLs, eat your free lunch, get your middling performance scores, and collect your above-average paycheck, all the while crusading on memegen or whining about how unfair it is that the company evaluates your performance twice per year. If that's what you want to do, Google is the place for you. But if you're the kind of person who wants to advance technology, to apply your intellect to hard problems, and to bring something new into the world, then (unless you get extraordinarily lucky with team placement) Google will suffocate you. Go anywhere else.",Elevate technical excellence over internal politics.,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,google

Not a gateway to Google: I joined thinking that the I could work in Finance for a while learning new skills and working on cool projects on my way to moving into the eng org. This is generally not the case. What I didn't realize when I joined is that I was on a Finance ladder. As a result, transferring to the eng org involves a full interview process.

However, the company needs to continue building on these things to truly move in the right direction in being an ""exceptional place where people come to do their best work"".

- Stop focusing on how to place your white male buddies additional Executive Director and Senior Director positions and focus on promoting the growth and success of the associates that truly drive the business
- We see that you're trying to ""promote"" diversity & inclusion in the company, but saying and doing are two different things
- Really take the Rate Your Stay results about growth, development, and compensation to heart as opposed to acknowledging it is a problem and putting a band-aid over it

- Very flexible WFH policies

- Easy to move up if you're willing to relocate
- Good job if you like talking to people on the phone a lot"," Incredibly boring job that doesn't make you feel any level of fulfillment. You'll spend 9-5 calling hotels and begging them for the best rates and room availability. There's not much strategy outside of that.
- Lots of recent changes that have made the role even more robotic than it was before. Leadership has removed team leadership positions that previously would allow market associates to gain more experience in other areas such as finance or marketing. Now, they only want you to focus on contacting as many hotels as possible. Quantity > quality.
- Very difficult to move up if you're unwilling to relocate. If you don't want to relocate, it's practically seniority-based so you better hope a few people above you leave! (pretty common since there is high turnover in market management)
- Not challenging at all, and you won't develop really any technical skills. On most days I'd think ""I can't believe I went to college to be doing THIS.""
- The technology is very poor, so often times it's difficult to do your day-to-day job","This role is essentially a glorified sales call center, and I don't think that is made very clear in the job description.

5478,Mon Sep 16 2019 22:55:18 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), Engagement Specialist,"Bellevue, WA",Former Employee ,Great company to work for... if you're in the right department.,I worked at Expedia Group full-time for more than 3 years,2.0,"I was able to work at Expedia for 3 years. I started out as a contractor in one department then was able to make my way into a permanent position in another department. I will list out below about the positives of working here.

-Work/Life balance is fantastic for a corporation. I feel like the Expedia as a whole cares about their employees and wants to make sure they can actually have a life outside of work. Over-time, at least in my positions, was never a thing. If you couldn't finish your work, you just come back to it the next day without sweating it. 

-Benefits are solid. Starting out of the gate, you get 15 days of PTO plus 2 floating holidays. You also have 401k, health insurance options, health and wellness reimbursements up to $600 bucks and a bit of travel reimbursements. They are also willing to match up to 6% of what you invest for 401k. If you happen to work at HQ, they also provide an onsite health clinic and gym for employees. 

-Flexible schedules - I started my day at 6am every day just to be able to beat out traffic and was out of the office generally at 2-2:30pm.

-They work hard on making sure everyone feels welcome and included no matter race or culture. They put an effort into having company events for a wide variety of different holidays. 

-Managers that you can relate with. I had excellent managers that actually care about how you are doing and want to know what is going on in your personal life to better accommodate you in the office.

-They do want to retain people when they can. If you do your job well as a contractor, there is a good chance that they are looking to make you into a permanent employee, unlike companies like Amazon that will work people hard for 3-6 months then toss them out like office trash.","Depending on what department you get into, it can affect how you work and how you might feel about your job.

-Some departments love using time trackers such as the Omni tool to keep tabs of what their employees are doing during the day. Upper management will say that they don't micromanage until they force your direct manager to sit down and talk about your numbers to find out how you can be 'more efficient' even if you already have good numbers.

-Upper management will sometimes blatantly ignore what is being said among their employees. If big changes are made to the department, they rather stay the course even if it's burning out their workforce, just to say that something is working even though it isn't.

-There isn't much room for advancement. Managers/leads tend to stay in the company for a long time, so those who are below them will hit a point where they can't advance and compensation ends up not being enough. 

-If you don't use all your PTO in the year, it's gone. There is no rollover for PTO but there is for sick time. Managers do make sure to mention this to their employees pretty often throughout the year but there should be some rollover. 

-The HR department is an absolute wreck. First off, you would think a corporation of this size should have a physical department on-site at HQ. Every one of them is remote, which makes it extremely difficult to get anything done in a timely manner. When you have something pressing to talk to HR about, you can expect it to be anywhere from 2-5 days of waiting. Yep, DAYS!!! It's infuriating when you are trying to be time conscious and they don't seem to give a damn.

-If you are applying for a job, don't expect to hear back from them anytime soon. Expect on average about 50+ days to hear back from them, even if it is just to send a rejection.","The main thing is to listen more to your employees. The company promotes this but it seemed to start slipping more towards the end of my time there.

Also, please fix HR, make a physical location for employees. If it's taking as long as I said it was to get a response, which it does, either have more training for those already there to field calls or hirer more people. Maybe have them on the time trackers instead of others that are making good use of their time.",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,expedia

They provide good benefits and a nice downtown office. I absolutely loved this company and this job before a particular person came into their management position. I was passionate about the business and excited for what was next.","I had my work/life balance privileges ""suspended"" for 2 months (eligible after 6 months, I received at 8 months with the company). She allowed other employees on our team who had been working here for less than 6 months to work from home and leave early for things such as hair appointments, while denying every request I made in this regard. These instances were a huge deterrent to me, and my confidence level plummeted, as I was being treated obviously differently than my peers.

I had many meetings with my manager about the management and feedback style that works best for me, as well as what I respond best to as an employee. She continued to disregard my requests and only notify me of mistakes and shortcomings, never an encouragement nor a thank you. The continuous negativity towards me took a real toll on my morale as an employee.
 
My manager's way of ""coaching"" me was to reiterate that me working for Expedia was like “trying to fit a round peg in a square hole” and that it would be “very mature” of me to decide that this job isn’t for me. In my opinion, because of someone who’s role is to grow and develop a team of people, I felt extremely discouraged and almost pushed out. I felt marginalized, disrespected, and discouraged by my manager almost every single day, and this took a sincere toll on my confidence and self-respect.","I had always been told at Expedia to fail fast and fail forward. However, certain members of the Denver leadership team do not seem to follow this principle that Expedia preaches, and tend to continually punish anyone who makes any mistakes. If 4 people have been ""fired"" and/or left the company in the past year, perhaps management should start looking at the leader of this team as the issue, as opposed to the employees themselves... 

I was also a bit disappointed in HR during my last few weeks with the company. I was told by an HR rep that she would send over some talking points for me when discussing leaving with my team, as well as an email template for a farewell email note. I never received any of these documents, even after reaching back out and asking twice for them. I also requested an exit interview, which the HR rep missed and asked to reschedule for Monday – However, it was my last day...",2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,expedia

Analysts are on LinkedIn and can provide you an insight on how it is on the floor. Trust has been lost in senior management and analysts are no longer working special projects, but all analysts are working like they are FA I's. There is a push to meet booking volume so extreme changes were made in people's work schedules and their work load to make them all do the same thing no matter their level.

Career advancement is non existent. No more special projects to work on. Recognition and awards are no longer handed out.

There have been some recent promotions within the department, that those that were promoted were told they could keep their favorable schedules instead of giving those schedules to the seasoned analysts who have been there longer. Not sure why this decision was made, but it has caused the morale in the team sink even further. There is no trust that you can end up with a better schedule now.

There are large numbers of people who work 8hours a day 5 days a week, maximum. The stress is very low for these people.
Expedia is stable and the risk of company failure is very, very low. Layoffs are also not likely outside of very specific instances involving handfulls of people.
Management avoids terminating FTEs, to the point of keeping low performers.
There are many benefits not found at many other companies.
Management and senior ICs get to travel internationally a lot.","Expedia is not a Technology company. It says it wants to be, but it is a Travel company first, controlled by the Product organization.
Conversion, and related KPI's, are more important than anything else.
Expedia's technical management, from fist line managers to VPs, are often not technical and have no programming experience. No one at that level talks about ""Big O"", Algorithms, Data Structures or other CS concepts.
Monolithic thinking permeates architect and management thinking.
Most ideas and all decisions are top-down. People are told what to do. Problems are solved at the executive level and dictated into the organizations.
Expedia Group is really many separate businesses, each with a separate and different culture, tech stack, standards and processes. Silos, and the walls they create, are everywhere.
Social Justice programs are promoted by everyone in management, and speaking out against them is just not done by anyone. There is no debate or discussion.
Strong technical leaders are not embraced by the leadership community, and leave. Most strong developers leave for more challenging and fast paced companies. If you want to learn from great technologists, Expedia is not the place.","Keep an office in Bellevue after the move to Seattle.
Set a technical bar for technical leaders (EM to VP), hold people to it, and remove those that don't meet it.
Tenure should not be a criteria in promotions. Tenure should not influence a yearly performance review/rating/raise/bonus. Those with no experience outside Expedia are at risk of not having the experience necessary to accomplish the ""Transformation"" Expedia is attempting.
Stop letting past personal relationships determine who gets promoted into VP level roles and base it instead on performance.

A lot of managers are afraid to be truthful about the nature of the job, which is ultimately sales and technical support with a little bit of training so they dance around tough situations and sometimes aren't honest with the team. There is a lot of politics involved with promotions. Favoritism is definitely a factor. In some cases it doesn't matter how experienced you are or how knowledgable you are, if you want to get promoted you've got to play the game. Feedback is something that in most cases isn't used properly. Apple hires very smart people at retail division, then once they are in, the managers don't really know (or sometimes care) how to develop them.

I told them before my firing that this would really be rock bottom for me and that is kill myself. When they fired me in a webcam session I honestly considered it, and with 2 managers on camera pulled my gun out cocked it and put it to my head on camera. They didn't respond or do anything before I told them I need to leave and shut down my computer. I dare anyone at Apple to pull that session since I know it's recorded, but that's who you're dealing with You'll be screwed time and again on your schedule so just get used to that. 4 years I was there, never once did I get the schedule I wanted or anything close to it. And you'll be severally chastised for asking questions about it, the last time I did I was mysteriously fired 2 days later. The times for that by the way are 1pm-2am EST. So if you can't work those hours don't bother applying because these people simply don't care. No matter what you are the customers punching bag, no it's ands or buts. This company will never have your back. Moving up is impossible because for one there's been a hiring freeze since 2016 and two you'll have a million managers in your time each resetting your progress, asking you the same questions as the last until you're ground pulp and give up.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,apple
